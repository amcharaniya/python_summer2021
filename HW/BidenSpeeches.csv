Remarks on Fighting the COVID-19 Pandemic and an Exchange with Reporters
","
THE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon. Last week, I laid out what we need to do to beat the COVID-19 vi- -- pandemic and the challenges posed by the Delta variant.
This is a very different variant than what we've dealt with previously. It's highly transmissible, and it's causing a new wave of cases. It accounts for over 80 percent of all COVID-19 cases in the United States today. Experts tell us that we're going to see these cases rise in the weeks ahead -- a largely preventable tragedy that will get worse before it gets better.
What's different about this surge from previous ones is we have the tools to prevent this rise in cases from shutting down
our businesses, our schools, our society, as we saw what happened last year.
And while cases are on the rise, it's important to note we've not seen a comparable rise in hospitalizations or deaths in most areas of the country.
That's because 165 million Americans are fully vaccinated, including 80 percent of the most vulnerable Americans -- our seniors.
The best line of defense against the Delta vac- -- the virus is the vaccine. It's as simple as that. Period. The vaccine.
I want to be crystal clear about what's happening in the country today: We have a pandemic of the unvaccinated.
Now, I know there's a lot of misinformation out there, so here are the facts: If you're vaccinated, you are highly unlikely to get COVID-19. And even if you do, the chances are you won't show any symptoms; and if you do, they'll most likely be very mild.
Vaccinated people almost never are hospitalized with COVID-19. In fact, according to one recent study, 95 percent of overall COVID-19 hospitalizations are among those not fully vaccinated.
And the data shows that virtually all the cases, hospitalizations, and deaths due to COVID-19 are from the unvaccinated population.
Last month, a study showed that over 99 percent of COVID-19 deaths have among -- have been among the unvaccinated people. Ninety-nine percent.
That means, if you're unvaccinated, you are much more likely to, one, get COVID-19; two, get hospitalized; and, three, die if you get it.
This is a tragedy. People are dying and will die who don't have to die. The data is absolutely clear: As I've said, we have a pandemic of the unvaccinated.
Think of it this way: A hundred and ninety-one million Americans have gotten at least one shot, including 70 percent of adults over the age of 18. A hundred and sixty-five million Americans are fully vaccinated, but about ninety million Americans are eligible for vaccines and still haven't gotten their first shot.
You know, I think there's a clear link between the lowest-vaccinated -- I know -- I don't think, actually -- the lowest-vaccinated states and the states with the highest case rates.
This past week, the most vaccinated state in America,
Vermont, has seen just five new cases -- five -- per day of COVID-19 for every 100,000 people who live in that state. That means, on any given day, only 30 people in the entire state of Vermont got COVID-19.
Nearby Maine, which has vaccinated almost 80 percent of their adults, has seen just six new cases per 100,000.
But the states with the lowest vaccination rates are seeing 10 to 20 times as many new cases per 100,000 people. It's moving like wildfire through the unvaccinated community. And it's heartbreaking, particularly because it's preventable.
That's why we're doing everything we can to get more people vaccinated. And we're seeing real results.
In the past two weeks, we have seen a 55 percent increase in the average number of new people getting vaccinated every day.
In the last seven days alone, nearly 3 million Americans have gotten their first shot. That's the highest seven-day total in a month.
Importantly, over the past two weeks, the eight states with the highest current case rates have seen a doubling of the number of people newly vaccinated each day. The message is getting through, apparently.
Louisiana has seen a 212 percent increase in the average number of newly vaccinated people in that state per day, going from 3,600 to over 11,000 people vaccinated per day.
Arkansas is up 99 percent. Mississippi is up 125 percent. Alabama is up 186 percent -- going from 3,200 to 9,150 people vaccinated per day. This will make a big difference.
These are encouraging signs. We have to continue our aggressive efforts to vaccinate the unvaccinated.
Last week, I announced additional steps to incentivize Americans to get vaccinated, including calling on states to offer $100 for anyone willing to step up and get a vaccination shot.
You know, and already Minnesota and New Mexico have done that. And North Carolina announced its 100-day incentive -- its $100 incentive today.
Places that have offered the hundred thou- -- the hundred thousand -- (laughs) -- the hundred dollars -- that'd be really good. I'd go back and get vaccinated three times. (Laughter.) But all kidding aside, offered the $100 to get vaccination have seen an uptick of 25 percent of daily vaccination rates.
We also announced that small- and medium-sized businesses will be fully reimbursed for offering paid time off for their employees to get vaccinated and for them to take a child or a parent to get vaccinated.
And I announced some tough, sometimes unpopular steps to keep people safe and our economy strong. All federal workers must report their vaccination status or be subject to strict requirements. Any federal worker who does not attest to their vaccination status or is not vaccinated will be required to mask no matter where they work, test one to twice a week, socially distance, and generally will not be allowed to travel for work.
I directed my administration to take steps to apply similar standards to all federal contractors. If you want to do business with the federal government, get your workers vaccinated.
And I also directed the Pentagon to look at adding COVID-19 to the list of vaccinations that are required for our troops because others are required.
I approved the Department of Veterans Affairs to require doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers who care for our veterans to be vaccinated.
And the good news is that now many are following the federal government's lead. In the past several days, states and local officials have come out to impose similar vaccination mandates.
And the private sector is stepping up as well. Even Fox has vaccination requirements. I want to thank Walmart, Google, Netflix, Disney, Tyson Foods for their recent actions requiring vaccination for employees.
Look, I know this isn't easy, but I will have their backs and the backs of other private and public sector leaders if they take such steps.
But others have declined to step up. I find it disappointing. And worst of all, some state officials are passing laws or signing orders that forbid people from doing the right thing.
As of now, seven states not only ban mask mandates, but also ban them in their school districts, even for young children who cannot get vaccinated. Some states have even banned businesses and universities from requiring workers and students to be masked or vaccinated.
And the most extreme of those measures is like the one in Texas that say state universities or community colleges could be fined if it allows a teacher to ask her unvaccinated students to wear a mask.
What are we doing?
COVID-19 is a national challenge, and we must come together -- we have to come together -- all of us together, as a country, to solve it.
Make no mistake: The les- -- the exc- -- ex- -- excuse me -- the escalation of cases is particularly concentrated in states with low vaccination rates. Just two states, Florida and Texas, account for one third of all new COVID-19 cases in the entire country. Just two states.
Look, we need leadership from everyone. And if some governors aren't willing to do the right thing to beat this pandemic, then they should allow businesses and universities who want to do the right thing to be able to do it.
I say to these governors, ""Please, help."" But if you aren't going to help, at least get out of the way of the people who are trying to do the right thing. Use your power to save lives.
I've made it our first and top priority to have a vaccine available for every single American from the day I got elected. That was my priority. And let me be clear: We have a supply for every single American, and that will never change.
At the same time, it's also in our national interest to share some of our vaccines with the world, which gets me to the second thing I want to discuss today.
From the beginning of my presidency, I've been very clear-eyed that we need to attack this virus globally, not just at home, because it's in America's self-interest to do so.
The virus knows no boundaries. You can't build a wall high enough to keep it out. There is no wall high enough or ocean wide enough to keep us safe from a vaccination in other -- from the COVID-19 in other countries.
In fact, just like the original virus that caused COVID-19, the Delta variant came from abroad. As long as the virus continue to rage outs- -- rage outside the United States, potentially more dangerous variants could arrive at our shores again.
And we know that COVID-19 in other countries stifles economic growth, disrupts supply chains, risks instability and weakness of governments. And as we've seen in the United States, the key to growing economies is to vaccinate people.
So just as the American economy is recovering, it's in all of our interests to have global -- the global economy begin to recover as well.
This is about our values. We value inherent dignity of all people -- the inherent dignity of everyone. In times of trouble, Americans reach out to offer a helping hand. That's who we are.
And I've said before: In this fight against COVID-19, the United States is committed to be the arsenal of vaccines, just as we were the arsenal of democracy during World War Two.
And we're backing up that commitment. We have contributed more than any other nation to COVAX -- the collective global efforts delivering COVID-19 vaccines across the world.
We have supported manufacturing efforts abroad through our partnerships with Japan, India, Australia –- known as ""the Quad.""
During my trip to Europe in June, I announced that the United States would purchase a groundbreaking 500 million doses of Pfizer and then donate them -- those doses -- nearly -- to nearly a hundred low- and middle-income countries who don't have the vaccine. Those doses will start to ship at the end of this month.
We also announced that we'd donate 80 million doses of our own vaccine to supply the world, which has already begun.
And today, I have an important update. We've already exceeded 80 million doses that have been -- gone out. As of today, the United States has shipped over 110 million doses of U.S. vaccines to 65 countries that are among the hardest hit in the world.
Let me say it again: As of today, we have shipped over 110 million doses to 65 nations.
According to the United Nations, this is more than the donations of all 24 countries that have donated any vaccine to other countries, including China and Russia -- all those nations combined.
These vaccine donations from America are free. We're not selling them. There are no demands, no conditions, no coercion attached. And there is no favoritism and no strings attached. We're doing this to save lives and to end this pandemic. That's it.
In fact, we're donating vaccines to countries that have real issues -- we have real issues with.
And we'll continue to give tens of millions of the doses away across the summer and work to increase U.S. manufacturing and manufacturing of vaccines around the world as well.
And it's not just vaccines. We are continuing to provide
countries with -- in need -- with more testing, protective equipment, and personnel to stem the surge of the virus. We've done it in India and elsewhere.
Let me close with this. I've said before: In the race for the 21st century between democracies and autocracies, we need to prove that democracies can deliver.
And the democracies of the world are looking to America to lead again -- in two ways. First, to demonstrate we can control this virus at home. And second, to show we can help address it around the world.
Vaccinate America and help vaccinate the world -- that's how we're about to beat this thing.
We're always going to have enough doses for every American who wants one. Our work in donating vaccines to the world is about America following through on our promises and delivering what we say we'll deliver.
It's showing how American science and technology, American businesses and academia, and our government can all work together.
Above all, it's proving democracies can deliver and, yet again, that America is back leading the world -- not by the example of our power, but by the power of our example.
We still have a lot of work to do. So if you're unvaccinated, please, please, please get the shot.
But just don't take it from me. Just read the news. Listen to the voices of the unvaccinated patients in the hospital. They are spending [sending] the most powerful message to their families and everyone around the world -- a powerful message to everybody. As they're lying in bed, many dying from COVID-19, they're asking, ""Doc, can I get the vaccine?"" The doctors have to look them in the eye and say, ""No, sorry. It's too late.""
Right now, too many people are dying or watching a loved one dying and saying, ""If I just got vaccinated. If I just…""
Folks, this is isn't about politics. The virus doesn't care if you're a Democrat or a Republican. This is about life and death. Life and death.
I can't say it any more plainly than this: The vaccine saves lives, and it could save yours or your child's.
You know, I know we can do this. We're the United States of America. We're prepared like never before. We have the tools and the resources to save lives at home and around the world.
This is who we are. This is what we do. This is why there's no nation like us on Earth.
God bless you all. And may God protect our troops.
And I'll take a few questions.
Q: Mr. President, I have a question for you on coronavirus, but first I'd like to start with the news of the day -- given, back in March, you said that if the investigation confirmed the allegations against Governor Cuomo, then he should resign. So, will you now call on him to resign, given the investigators said the 11 women were credible?
THE PRESIDENT: I stand by that statement.
Q: Are you now calling on him to resign?
THE PRESIDENT: Yes.
Q: And if he doesn't resign, do you believe he should be impeached and removed from office?
THE PRESIDENT: Let's take one thing at a time here. I think he should resign.
Q: Do you think --
THE PRESIDENT: I understand that the state legislature may decide to impeach. I don't know that for a fact; I've not read all that data.
Q: And he's using a photo of you embracing him in his self-defense to say that these are commonplace kind of embraces that he made in the allegations against him. Do you condone that?
THE PRESIDENT: Look, I'm not going to flyspeck this. I'm sure there are some embraces that were totally innocent, but app- -- apparently, the Attorney General decided there were things that weren't.
Q: And on coronavirus, if I could ask you a question about the evictions.
THE PRESIDENT: Why don't you come up and take the platform? (Laughter.)
Q: No, thank you.
On the evictions and the moratorium that lapsed on Saturday night: What is your strategy to prevent potentially millions of people from being evicted from their homes, given what we are told your administration is considering -- a targeted moratorium -- is likely to face legal challenges?
THE PRESIDENT: Any call for a moratorium based on the Supreme Court recent decision is likely to face obstacles. I've indicated to the CDC I'd like them to look at other alternatives than the one that is in pow- -- in existence, which the Court has declared they're not going to allow to continue. And the CDC will have something to announce to you in the next hour to two hours.
Q: Thank you.
Q: President Biden, on overseas coronavirus vaccines: Should other high-income countries follow the lead of the United States and increase donations to low- and middle-income countries?
THE PRESIDENT: I think those countries that have been able to cover their population and have the ability to provide either dollars and/or vaccine for the 100 or so na- -- poor nations that need help should do so. We had that discussion at the G7. A number of those countries said they were going to do that. Some have followed through.
The point I was making is, though, I've kept the commitment -- we've kept the commitment that we would do what we said, which is more than all the rest of the countries combined thus far.
Q: Mr. President, do you believe that Governor DeSantis and Governor Abbott are personally making decisions that are harming their own citizens?
THE PRESIDENT: I believe the results of their decisions are not good for their constituents. And it's clear to me and to most of the medical experts that the decisions being made, like not allowing mask mandates in school and the like, are bad health policy -- bad health policy.
Q: Mr. President, I have a question about something that you just said.
THE PRESIDENT: I'm sure you do.
Q: Thank you. You just said there is no wall high enough and no ocean wide enough to protect us from the virus. So what is the thinking behind letting untested and unvaccinated migrants cross the southern border into U.S. cities in record numbers?
THE PRESIDENT: There is -- what we're doing -- we have not withdrawn the order that is sometimes critical -- criticized -- saying that unvaccinated people should be -- go back across the border.
But unaccompanied children is a different story, because there's -- that's the most humane thing to do is to test them and to treat them and not send them back alone.
Q: Mr. President, have you spoken with Governor Cuomo today?
THE PRESIDENT: I have not.
Q: And then one other question on the virus. You just said we have -- we have to continue our aggressive efforts to get the unvaccinated vaccinated. Other countries have found a lot of success in requiring vaccines in public places. New York City just announced today that they'll require vaccines for restaurants and gyms. Do you think more cities and states should institute rules like that?
THE PRESIDENT: I do.
Q: And are you going to publicly call on them? Should they institute a vaccine passport-type system, or it's up to each city and state to figure that out on their own?
THE PRESIDENT: I'm sorry. What did you say?
Q: Do you think that they should institute a vaccine passport-type system or some sort of verification to use public spaces?
THE PRESIDENT: I don't think they need to do that. I think they just need to give the authority of those restaurants or businesses to say, ""In order to come in, you have to give proof that you've been vaccinated or you can't come in.""
I'll take a couple more.
Q: Mr. President can I ask you about news of the day -- one more on Governor Cuomo? You're calling for him to resign now. My question is: Do you think he should be prosecuted? And what is your message to the women who have now accused him of sexually harassing them and abusing them?
THE PRESIDENT: Look, what I said was: If the investigation of the Attorney General concluded that the allegations were correct, that -- back in March -- that I would recommend he resign. That's what I'm doing today. I've not read the report. I don't know the detail of it. All I know is the end result.
Q: Mr. President, a question on COVID, if I could, really quickly. It's the eviction moratorium. Can you explain a little bit more why it took so long to have a possible eviction moratorium be put into place? There was -- there are people -- this expired on Saturday. I'm wondering -- there are folks who are saying it took too long for this to happen.
THE PRESIDENT: Well, look, the courts made it clear that the existing moratorium was not constitutional; it wouldn't stand. And they made that clear back in, I guess, July 15th or July 18th.
In the meantime, what I've been pushing for and calling for is we have billions of dollars that were given to states to provide for rent and utilities for those people who can't afford to stay in their homes because they can't -- an apartment -- they can't pay their rent. And so, we're urging them to distribute those funds to the landlords. I believe that would take care of the vast majority of what needs to be done to keep people in their -- in their ho- -- in their apartments now.
And so that's what we're working on. Some states have done it and some communities have, but they have not. The money is there. It's not -- we don't have to send it out. It's been sent out to the states and counties -- billions of dollars -- for the express purpose of providing for back rent and rent for the people who are in the middle of this crisis. And that's there; that's what we're pushing now. And we've been pushing that. That's the immediate thing to do.
I'll take one more question.
Q: Mr. President, thank you so much. There was an expectation that you would be announcing new vaccines to the world today -- a new -- other than the ones you promised. Are you ready to send more vaccines to the world?
And there is a delegation from the White House going to Brazil tomorrow. Are they bringing more vaccines? Are they announcing more vaccines to Brazil?
THE PRESIDENT: No -- are they announcing more vaccines overall?
Q: Overall. And then to Brazil -- for the delegation coming to Brazil tomorrow -- will you be bringing vaccines?
THE PRESIDENT: The answer is: I don't know whether the delegation going physically has vaccines with them. We have provided vaccines to --
Q: Are they bringing the announcement? Are they announcing there?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, no, there's a need for several billion doses around the world. We have committed to over a half a billion doses. And we're trying to provide for more and provide for the capacity of countries like India to be able to produce the vaccine themselves. And we're helping them do that. That's what we're doing now.
And we're trying to -- we're -- and, by the way, it's free. We're not charging anybody anything. And we're trying to do as much as we possibly can.
Thank you all very much.
Q: Mr. President, we're learning that your administration is about to announce a new partial eviction moratorium, COVID related. Can you tell us any more about that? And are you sure it's going to pass Supreme Court muster?
THE PRESIDENT: The answer is twofold. One, I've sought out constitutional scholars to determine what is the best possibility that would come from executive action, or the CDC's judgment, what could they do that was most likely to pass muster, constitutionally.
The bulk of the constitutional scholarship says that it's not likely to pass constitutional muster. Number one. But there are several key scholars who think that it may and it's worth the effort. But the present -- you could not -- the Court has already ruled on the present eviction moratorium.
So I think what you're going to see, and I -- look, I want to make it clear: I told you I would not tell the Justice Department or the medical experts, the scientists what they should say or do. So I don't want to get ahead.
The CDC has to make the -- I asked the CDC to go back and consider other options that may be available to them. You're going to hear from them what those other options are.
I have been informed they're about to make a judgment as to potential other options. Whether that option will pass constitutional measure with this administration, I can't tell you. I don't know. There are a few scholars who say it will and others who say it's not likely to.
But, at a minimum, by the time it gets litigated, it will probably give some additional time while we're getting that $45 billion out to people who are, in fact, behind in the rent and don't have the money. That's why it was passed in -- in the act that we passed in the beginning of my administration, and it went to the states.
We were under the impression that the states were moving this money out relatively rapidly. So, for example, if I'm in an apartment -- if you're in an apartment, and you're behind on four- or five-month's rent, and let's say your rent is $2,000 a month -- I'm just making this up out of the blue -- and you're behind, you need $10,000 to catch up. Hardly anybody has that $10,000. But there is money that the states have that can give to the landlord that $10,000 to the back rent.
The future rent, it's unlikely -- at least the hope is, since they have been made whole to that point -- that they'd be inclined -- because the economy is growing -- inclined not to throw someone out in the street; keep that person -- no guarantee -- keep that person in the apartment, keep these kids in the same school district, and count on being able to have the opportunity for that -- that person to be able -- who may now be employed -- to pay their rent.
But in the meantime, I've asked, isn't there any safety valve we can put in? And it's the one I explained to you. Again, CDC will announce that and the details of exactly how it works. I'm not telling -- I told them I want them to take a look. I didn't tell them what they had to do.
And my hope is, it's going to be a new moratorium that in some way -- and I'm not going to announce it now; I'll let them announce it -- in some way covers close to 90 percent of the American people who are renters. And so that's all I can tell you now.
Thank you very much.
Q: Why not 100 percent? What's the difference?
THE PRESIDENT: Because it's a -- (laughs) -- let them explain that to you. Okay? I don't want to get too far ahead.
Thank you.
Q: Mr. President, is COVAX doing enough to get shots in arms?
Q: Why not call Governor DeSantis, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.) To say ""happy birthday""? What? I mean --
Q: To deliver the message that you seem to be delivering today about ""get out of the way.""
THE PRESIDENT: He knows the message. He knows the message. We had a little discussion when I was down there. He knows the message.
Q: What did he say to you in that discussion?
THE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.) See you all later.

Remarks in a Meeting with Latino Community Leaders and an Exchange with Reporters
","
THE PRESIDENT: Okay. Well, everybody, welcome. Today, I have the privilege of meeting with Latino leaders to discuss a bunch of key issues that affect the community; the progress we're making against the pandemic; historic and economic recovery we're under- -- that's undergoing -- we're undergoing; and immigration and voting rights, which are critical.
Latino leaders have been essential to helping us get the country vaccinated, with 70 percent of all adult Americans receiving at least one shot.
The vaccines work. Even as cases go up due to the highly transmissionable [sic] -- transmissible disease, the Delta variant, we're not seeing a comparable rise in hospitalizations or deaths in most of the country because of the vaccinations. This is an epidemic of the unvaccinated -- a pandemic of the unvaccinated.
But we need everyone to get vaccinated in this pandemic. And it's critical to keeping the economy strong.
And in six months, we're seeing the fastest job growth of any point in any administration in history from the beginning of their administration, and the fastest economic growth in nearly 40 years.
And we have an opportunity to make historic investments in infrastructure and in American families, and finally build an economy that deals everybody in.
I've been saying from the beginning when I announced that I'm tired of trickle down. It doesn't work very well. But when you build from the bottom up and the middle out, everybody does well, including the wealthy. That's what this is all about.
And so, creating millions of good-paying jobs in every community and -- including Latino neighborhoods -- delivering affordable child and -- care and paid leave and universal pre-K, two years of community college.
You know, today marks, as we all know -- no one knows this better than this community – a two-year -- two years of -- since the shooting in El Paso. And all of us have, in our personal lives, lost people unexpectedly. Most of us have. We know how devastating it is, particularly one that was born out of such hatred.
But you know, I did a piece -- Jill and I did a piece for the El Paso Times, but I realized after it was published that I didn't talk about an aspect that is really important: There were 236 people who were wounded. How are they doing? The trauma. The equivalent of post-traumatic stress that comes from these kinds of things. I -- and the need for -- and I hope we'll -- we can talk about it a little bit later as well -- is the need for mental health services and a whole range of things that affect not only them but their families when they've survived.
But to the families who have lost loved ones, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart, Jill and send our love -- as all of you do, I know.
But I know, you know, these anniversaries are -- should be celebrated in a sense of recognize -- so we see things don't happen again. But, you know, they're terrible for the victims and the survivors because it brings back everything like it happened the very moment ago. And I -- it takes enormous courage for people to -- to respond that way.
You know, and I know how hard these anniversaries are. As I said, no matter how much time has passed, it brings it all back like it happened that second.
The El Paso community -- you know, they continue to show their courage and the resilience. But to all Americans, this tragedy reminds us of the unfinished work to heal -- and I know I got criticized for running on it, but I really mean it -- heal the soul of this country. We have to return to some decency and honor, and I just -- anyway.
The gunman targeted people and the diversity of El Paso and our most deeply held American values. And, you know, we all act together to counter what is basically domestic terrorism, domestic violence, domestic extremism, and end the scourge of gun violence in America. We can't end it, but we sure can make a big difference than what it is now. And so, I continue to do everything in my power to do that.
The most lethal terrorist threat to our homeland in recent years is domestic terrorism -- domestic terrorism rooted in white supremacy. We're going to have to stand united against this violence because it just spills over to all communities.
And my administration is carrying out the country's first-ever comprehensive effort to tackle the threat of domestic terrorism -- from reducing online radicalization to disrupting networks that inspire violence, and providing resources to communities to build up some resilience.
And I'm going to continue to fight this for more commonsense gun laws. And we're going to continue to call on Congress to take action, which they've been reluctant to do.
That includes a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines like the one used in El Paso. The idea anybody needs, for a pistol and/or a rifle -- anyone needs 10, 12, 20, 30, 100 rounds in a rifle is just -- it just makes no sense at all. Zero. Doesn't violate anybody's Second Amendment rights to say, ""You can't do that."" But it just has to stop.
And that includes using my existing authority, which I have, to -- from reining in ""ghost guns"" and -- to investing in community policing and community violence intervention, to having -- bringing in psychologists and social workers into the police forces to help.
And, you know, I look forward to hearing from this group about all of these issues and a lot more. And -- but, with that, we're going to discuss a wide range of issues, all of us here tonight -- today. And I'm looking forward to it.
So, thank you all. Thank you, press, for being here.
Q: Mr. President, should Andrew Cuomo resign, sir? Should Andrew Cuomo resign?
THE PRESIDENT: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Q: Should Andrew Cuomo resign, sir?

I'm going to be speaking on COVID at four o'clock this afternoon, and I'll take questions on COVID and other issues after that.
Thank you.

Remarks at a Virtual Fundraising Reception for the Democratic National Committee
","
Via Teleconference
7:19 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Tom. Thanks for that introduction and for your generous support. And I want to thank you all. And, Jamie, for your support as well and being willing to take on the chairmanship.
You know, I didn't have it like you did, but I remember when my dad -- when things died up in Scranton; the coal dried up. He wasn't a coalminer; my great grandfather was. But he wasn't a coalminer, but everything else dried up. And he said -- I remember him going home to my grandpop, who had four sons and a daughter, and asking him is it okay if his wife -- my mother, Jean -- and the three kids move in with him for a year or so until they got straightened away down in northern Delaware -- a little town called Claymont.
And so that -- and he said -- I'll never forget it. He said, ""I'll come home every weekend, Joey. Every weekend. There's only 147 -- 157 miles."" And I thought, ""My God, that's a million miles."" I was going -- I was in third grade, going into fourth. And you know, it's a --
They used to have an expression -- and that's never -- and this is the God's truth. We got down to Delaware, as he worked his way through, after five years, being able to buy a small three-bedroom home. He used to say, ""Joey, a job is a lot more than a paycheck. It's about -- it's about your pride. It's about your place in the community. It's about your ability to look your kids in the eye. It's about your dignity."" And so it's much -- so much more.
And so, you know, when I ran with your help -- and I couldn't have made it -- with all the help of people on this line -- you know -- you know, we are part of something special because you allowed me to compete.
We -- I think we put together one of the most consequential campaigns in modern history. Because it really was, in my view, a battle for the soul of the nation: basic decency, building the middle class form the bottom up and the middle out, rather than waiting for everything to trickle down.
And a lot of you are very successful people on the line, but you shared that view and you gave me the money and contributions to be able to complete -- you know, I say -- I should say ""compete.""
And so, we're bound together in one of the most consequential first six months in the history of this country not because of me -- it's about the country; it's about people stepping up.
Think about the last six months. The American Rescue Plan.
We delivered shots in arms of millions and millions of people. Checks in pockets to hundreds of millions of Americans. And maybe the thing that I'm proudest of: We got the biggest middle-class tax cut of all time with the help of the -- cutting the child poverty in half through the childcare -- the Child Tax Credit.
And 165 million Americans are fully vaccinated. You got over 190 that have at least one shot -- one shot.
It's the fastest job growth in the first four months of any previous presidency. Period.
And a projected economic growth at nearly 7 percent -- the highest in four decades.
And last week, they -- the infrastructure plan that I introduced when I was running and put together with a bipartisan group -- I had to make some compromises, but it's going to make a gigantic difference.
For example, it's going to transform the economy. It's over -- over a trillion dollars. It's going to eliminate all lead pipes in America so people have decent drinking water. Build roads up to -- up to snuff so we build them back to, you know, making sure that they are where the environment is now -- not -- we have to build them back better. Childcare. The caring economy. The eldercare. The things that the American public wants most.
Man, look -- and delivering high-speed Internet to every American. Delivering clean water, as I said, to every American.
Building more resilient power grids. Installing electric vehicle charging stations-- over 500,000. The largest investment in public transit in rail since the creation of Amtrak 50 years ago.
But it's all about, as my dad's notion, it's about creating good-paying American jobs for millions of middle-class people and the working-class people. And it's about our economic competitiveness.
You know, as a -- as the Democratic Party, I think we're going to be able to say, going into these off-year elections, as the chairman said, that we can deliver. We can deliver for the American people. We can bring the country together. We can make a difference in their lives.
And, you know, it's about including everyone this time around -- Black, Latino, Asian American, Native American communities -- because I said the administration and our efforts would reflect what the country looked like.
And as I said, we're in the race for the 21st century economy and the rest of the world is not hanging around and waiting. We have to move fast.
And the bottom line, for me, is this: that we're signaling -- we're signaling to the rest of the world and to ourselves that we can function, we can deliver, we can do significant things. And we've got a lot more to do as we invest in physical infrastructure, also invest in human infrastructure, childcare, paid leave, universal pre-K through two years of -- and two years of community college.
When I hear about, ""Well, you know, that's not -- that's not investing"" -- well, let me tell you, when I was Vice President, I was asked to do a survey along the Secretary of Commerce of the 500 CEOs of the five -- Fortune 500 to see what their greatest needs are. We got the 340-some. You know what they said, almost to a person? They said, ""We need a better-educated public."" Well, they're not educating the public. And so, what are we going to do?
If I said to you tomorrow, ""We can maintain exorbitant tax cuts for the super wealthy"" -- and many of you are -- ""or we can make sure that every kid, starting at age three, four, and five, is in preschool, not daycare, and they have access to community college so we're the best-educated public in the world,"" which do you think is going to best promote the country's growth? You know what it is.
So, look, let me close. I'm -- I'm taking too much time. I want to meet each one of you. But, look, we need -- the single-most important thing that we have to do is we have to protect the voting system, protect the sacred right to vote. It's under assault in ways I haven't seen in my entire career. And I was the guy who was able to get the Voting Rights exten- -- Act extended 25 years before, when I was Chairman of the Judiciary Committee. And it wasn't until the Supreme Court came along and said, ""No, no, don't need it anymore.""
It's about who gets to vote and whether the vote counts, and who gets to count that vote. We have a system that does both those things with independence and integrity. But what Republicans want to do is say a political party gets to decide if a vote counts. It's outrageous. We're going to fight like hell so that doesn't happen. That's one of the most important things we can do.
There's a lot of work ahead. It's not going to be easy. But I'm going to need you to do it. The DNC is going to need you. And because -- here's the deal: We won in 2020 as a unified party. As we look to 2022, we need to stay unified. The question the American people are going to be asking is whether we're helping them and their families, and do we understand what they're going through; do we understand their problem; can we deliver for them.
You know, as Democrats, we have to show that we understand, number one; we're delivering, number two; and we're keeping our promise. We just have to keep making our case -- just as the Republican party today offers nothing but fear, lies, and broken promises. We have to keep cutting through the Republican fog --that the government isn't the problem, and show that we, the people -- we, the people, are always the solution.
We're the most unique country in the history of the world. You've heard me say this before. We're the only country that's organized based on an ide- -- on an idea, not religion, ethnicity, geography -- on an idea that we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men and women are critical equal, endowed -- you know the rest.
But you have to be able to vote. It's the single-most important thing we could do. And we're going to have to win races up and down the ticket.
You know, in 2018, I was out of office, but I campaigned in 58 districts -- congressional districts they said we couldn't win. We won back the United States Congress.
And, look, if we make the right decision in the next few years, in 50 years people are going to look back and say, ""This was the moment that America won the 21st century."" I really believe that. But we can't do it without you. You know, we have to prove that democracies can work.
I'll conclude by saying -- and the press on the line has heard me say this before -- that Xi Jinping, and -- who I met hours and hours with -- over 25 hours -- 24 hours alone. When I won, he called me to congratulate me. We spent two hours and, I think, almost 25 minutes on the phone.
He believes, along with other autocrats, that in the modern world, things are changing so rapidly, so quickly that democracies can't get their acts together and unite to compete with -- with autocratic governments. He truly believes that. And he's decided that they're going to be the most powerful military force in the world, and the largest economy and the most organized economy in the world by 2045.
We've got to demonstrate that democracies can work and protect. And I think it's going to impact on our influence around the world more than anything.
That's why we have to do some of this stuff together with others to get it done -- get it done. And I'm convinced there's not much we can't do. I think the country is ready. And because of you, I think we're going to be able to get it done.
But I want to thank you all. Thank you for everything you've done. And, you know, we got to prove we can make democracy work again. That's what it's about.
So, God bless you all for what you've done and going -- going to do. And may God protect our troops.

Remarks in a Meeting with Cuban American Leaders and an Exchange with Reporters
","
THE PRESIDENT: Well, I'm honored to welcome members of the Cuban American community, and Senator Menendez, Senator [Congressman] Meeks to discuss how the United States is going to continue to stand with the Cuban people, who have suffered for decades and decades under a failed communist regime.
Earlier this month, Cubans took to the street in a historic demonstration of the will of the people of Cuba. The regime responded with violence and repression, mass detentions, sham trials, and people disappearing who -- who have spoken out. Just disappearing. Family members, I'm told, are not able -- have no idea where their family members are back in Cuba. And -- in a brazen violation of the rights of the Cuban people.
The Cuban Americans are hurting. They're hurting because their loved ones are suffering. And it's, quite frankly, intolerable.
So, I want the Cuban Americans to know that we -- all around this table and myself included -- see your pain, we hear your voices, and we hear the cries of freedom coming from the island.
The United States is taking concerted action to bolster the cause of the Cuban people. We've brought to bear the strength of our diplomacy, rallying nations to speak out and increase pressure on the regime. And we're holding the regime accountable.
Last week, we sanctioned the head of Cuban armed forces and the government -- a government entity called the ""Black Berets"" for their involvement in suppressing protesters.
And, today, we are adding sanctions against the Revolutionary National Police, as well as individual sanctions against the chief and deputy chief -- the chief and deputy chief.
And we're going to continue to add sanctions on individuals that carry out -- that carry out the regime's abuses.
At the same time, we're increasing direct support for the Cuban people by pursuing every option available to provide Internet access to help the Cuban bypass -- the Cuban people bypass the censorship that's being mandatorily imposed.
You always know something is not going well when the -- a country will not allow -- will not allow their people to be engaged in -- be on the Internet and being able to make their case known around the world.
And we're expanding our assistance to political prisoners and dissidents.
And the direct State -- and I've directed the State Department and the Treasury Department to provide me, within one month, recommendations of how to maximize the flow of remittances to the Cuban people, without the Cuban military taking their cut.
And we're working to increase U.S. staffing at our embassy while prioritizing the safety of our personnel.
So, we've got a lot to discuss with this group. So, we got -- and mostly, I'm here to listen. I want to know what their ideas are. And you are some of the best experts on the issue.
The first person to bring this to my attention and to make sure that we were on top of this was Senator Menendez. And we think that -- you know, the American -- the Cuban American people are actually the best ambassadors for the Cuban people.
And so, my administration is going to make sure that their voices are included and uplifted at every step of the way. And we're gong to get down to business.
So, thank you all for bothering to come in. I appreciate it.
Q: Will there be more sanctions coming up, Mr. President? Or is that it, today?
THE PRESIDENT: I beg your pardon?
Q: I said: Will there be more sanctions against Cuba coming up or are you stopping with what you did today?
THE PRESIDENT: We are -- there will be more, unless there's some drastic change in Cuba, which I don't anticipate.
Thank you.

Remarks with the Vice President in a Virtual Meeting with Governors on Wildfires
","
THE PRESIDENT: Jay, you're beginning to convince the American people there is a thing called ""climate crisis."" About time. (Laughs.)
GOVERNOR INSLEE: Indeed.
THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you all for being here. I'm going to make a brief statement here and then we'll get to ask the Vice President to say a few words, get to some questions, and we'll get down to business, if that's okay with you all.
You know, one month ago, we convened the first of what will be a regular presidential briefing on wildfire preparedness. And we're joined by many of the governors who -- we were joined by many of the governors who are with us today, as well as experts from across the administration and leaders from the electric utility sector.
I said then that the threat of Western wildfires this year was as severe as it's ever been. And in the past month, we've sadly seen the truth of that being played out.
Since our -- our last meeting, the number of large, uncontained wildfires has nearly doubled to 66 -- 66 of those fires. And the number of firefighters on the job to battle them has tripled. Over 3.4 million acres have already burned.
In Oregon, the Bootleg Fire has destroyed more than 400 structures, including more than 160 homes. In California, the Dixie Fire has grown to over 220,000 acres and our firefighters are working in really rugged and dangerous conditions and terrain.
The number of states are experiencing the impacts of smoke from these fires, degrading their air quality, not just where the fires are burning, but all the states moving east -- not all, but most.
In short, we've got big, complex wildfires burning across multiple areas. And despite the incredible -- and I'm not -- this is not being solicitous -- the incredible bravery and heroism of our firefighters, our resources are already being stretched to keep up. We need more help, particularly when we also factor in the additional nationwide challenges of pandemic-related supply chain disruptions and our ongoing efforts to fight COVID.
We've had a few COVID clusters at our fire camps, which further limits resources. It's just one more reason why it's so darn important that everyone get vaccinated, I might add.
Sadly, we've also lost two brave firefighters in the last month in a plane crash in Arizona, and five were seriously injured last week battling the Devil's Creek fire in Montana.
It's -- to state the obvious, and you governors know it better than anybody -- it is really, really dangerous work, and it takes incredible bravery to do it. And these heroes deserve to be paid -- and paid well -- for their work. That's why, last month, I was able to announce -- and it's not paying that well, in my view, to be honest with you -- immediate action to make all federal firefighters making at least $15 an hour. I think they deserve more than that.
We're also working with Congress to make sure that our firefighters are paid better permanently. Permanently. So far, FEMA has approved 20 Fire Management Assistance Grants totaling up to $100 million to help states pay for the cost of fighting these fires.
We're also working with FEMA and the Defense Logistical Agency to get ahead of this emergency supply chain challenges. And we still have some supply chain challenges relating to hoses and a number of other things.
We're trapped -- we've tapped additional aircraft from the Department of Defense to aid in the fire detection and firefighting. We also welcome the support of our allies, from Australia, for example, sending a large air tanker to which it's going to begin flying missions this week.
And last month, I also noted that the EPA would be launching an upgrade app for mobile phones to easily share location-specific information with the public about the effects of fire and smoke on air quality for them. It's now even more important, because smoke from many of these fires burning in the West and along the Canadian border is affecting air quality in states across the country.
As of today, the upgrade app -- the upgrade AirNow app is live and ready for use. Folks in affected areas should download this important tool as quickly as possible.
I also encourage our states and county leaders to continue partnering with FEMA, as many of the leaders on the scene today are leveraging our Public Alert and Warning systems to communicate information directly and quickly about -- to the public about wildfires, evacuations, power outages, and more.
I know several of the governors' states have used this system recently and send -- to send warnings of evacuation orders, and it has undoubtedly helped people and, we don't know for certain, but likely saved some lives.
But we're in for a long fight yet this year, and the only way we're going to meet those challenges is by working together.
Wildfires are a problem for all of us and we have to stay closely coordinated in doing everything we can for our people. That's why I asked the governors to join us -- Democrats and Republicans alike -- so they can update me and the Vice President directly on what they need and what we can possibly do more of. And so we can discuss what's needed today -- we have to meet an urgent danger at hand -- a plan for what we can do to make sure we're better prepared next time.
One of the important aspects of the -- of the bipartisan infrastructure deal that is before the Senate now is it includes billions of dollars -- billions of dollars -- to strengthen wildfire preparedness, resilience, and response.
It includes funding for prevention efforts, like forest management, and to restore millions of acres of high-risk areas to protect homes and public water sources for drinking. And -- you know, and overlaying all of this is the necessity to successfully confront climate change.
We may -- we have some significant changes we're making in these two pieces of legislation that, God willing, will pass in the next month or so.
But we can't ignore how the overlapping and intertwined factors of extreme heat, prolonged drought, and supercharged wildfire conditions are affecting the country.
And so, this is a challenge that demands our urgent, urgent action, both today and, as you all know better than anyone else in the country, not just today, but tomorrow, next year, and the year after.
And so, I want to thank you, Governors, for your leadership during what is an incredibly challenging period for all of you. God, love you. You're going through -- anyway. It's --
And I'd like to ask, now, the Vice President to make a few comments. And then, I have some questions for all and we get in a discussion, with your permission. Thank you.
Vice President.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Mr. President.
We stand with you. We stand with you, and this is a commitment from our administration that we will not only stand with you, but stay in touch with you, mostly to hear from you. We know that the way that we can help you manage and expand your capacity is through the partnership that we have -- the federal and state government, along with local governments.
This -- this issue is ongoing. Each year, as we have discussed, it gets worse. It affects real people -- everything from children who are breathing the smoke to parents who are up at night, concerned that they may get an evacuation order at any -- at any moment. So, know that we are here to maximize the federal capacity to support the states.
I'm in D.C., but, of course, I'm a California girl and I care deeply about this. We -- as I think I've shared with many of you, our family has been under evacuation orders in the last couple of years. And -- and our folks should not have to fear that they are -- they are going to lose their home, everything they have, much less risk their lives in these moments.
So, thank you all for your courage, for your leadership, and I look forward to staying in touch with you.
THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.
Folks, I asked the staff -- because I think it's -- I've had the great honor of being, over the last 15 years, in your states and in the wilderness areas and the national parks. And I asked my staff to put together maps where exactly where the fires are and the areas they're in and what they're affecting.
And so, I want to start off with you, Governor Gianforte, up in Montana. You have your hands full, man. And I -- looking at -- at the map, all away from, you know, Poverty Flats and Crooked Creek, all the way up into Ruby and Hay Creek, and the other end of the state. But the big fires look like they're in Trail Creek and Alder Creek -- in those areas that are significant.
And I got -- I have a simple question, and it's a complicated one, but what can we do for you that -- that we're just not getting done now? What additional help can we give you now that -- that is not -- not there yet?
I mean, cut through all the -- all the jargon about, you know, all that we policy wonks are talking about various programs. Bottom line: What do you need and can we help -- you know, that we haven't?
GOVERNOR GIANFORTE: Good morning, Mr. President, Madam Vice President. I want to thank you for the opportunity to join you, and I want to answer your question because there are some things we can do to collaborate and work closer together.
Just to give a moment of background: As we meet this morning, our heroic firefighters are confronting 19 largescale fires in Montana alone.
And to put that in perspective: Just since January 1st, we've had 1,600 fires start in Montana and we've burned about 220,000 acres. These wildfires threaten the safety of our communities.
That Poverty Flats fire that you mentioned, in the last week, burned from initial start to 65,000 acres currently threatening 1,200 households out in the Big Horn County area, our first responders. These devastate our local communities and the costs keep mounting. We've spent -- the state has spent $13 million since July 1st alone.
It could have been much worse. And this gets to your question, Mr. President. Without our state's commitment -- and we've shared this with Forest Service and BLM, and they've been very cooperative -- to aggressive initial attack, Montana -- without that commitment, we would have had many more largescale fires. And we ask that our federal partners join us in applying this operating principle. Whether it's a fire that starts on private, state, or federal land --
THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
GOVERNOR GIANFORTE: -- fires are easier to manage when they're smaller.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Mm-hmm.
GOVERNOR GIANFORTE: And when we get after them, we do much better.
As we continue to confront this wildfire season, we're also focused on addressing Montana's forest health crisis. We published, earlier this year, the Montana Forest Action Plan, which identifies 9 million acres of forest land with significant forest health issues and an elevated risk of wildfire. Of those acres at risk, we found about 4 million acres that would benefit most from cross-bounty [sic] -- boundary forest management.
Given the need to actively manage our forests, I've charged our Department of Natural Resources and Conservation to double the number of acres it treats with active forest management this year at 25,000 acres.
But this is just a starting point. We'll actively manage private, state, and federal land with a variety of treatment types, including thinning, logging, and prescribed burn.
We've also invested in 14 different cross-boundary projects in Montana this year. These projects demonstrate the importance of working together across ownership -- ownership boundaries to create meaningful, landscape-scale change. And using funds from the state's fire suppression account and the Forest Service State and Private Forestry Division, we'll expand existing work and jumpstart new activities.
But it's not up, totally, to us. We ask that our federal partners join us in doing what needs to be done year-round to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires.
Of the 9 million acres at high risk, 60 percent of those are on federal land. This makes tools like the Good Neighbor Authority and stewardship contracting more important than ever.
The benefits are really clear: We have healthier forests, improved wildlife habitats, more recreational opportunities, and more good-paying jobs, and, most importantly, less severe wildfires. Without active forest management, we can't be successful in our forest health improvements.
In closing, I just want to say -- I want to thank our federal partners. We have good collaborative relationships here in Montana with the Forest Service and BLM. I also want to thank Governor Newsom and Governor Cox for sending crews to help us deal with these fires that are currently burning. We have thousands of first responders on the frontlines, right now, protecting our communities, natural resources, and livelihoods across Montana, across the western United States.
So many people have sacrificed, and I can't thank them enough. We can't measure it in dollars spent or acres burns -- burned. We have to keep them and their loved ones in our thoughts and our prayers.
I agree with you, Mr. President. Now is the time to act. I think it's all about aggressive initial attack and getting more proactive in our forest management.
Again, Mr. President, Vice President Harris, I want to thank you for letting me join you today.
THE PRESIDENT: Greg, let me ask you another question, if I may. There's press in the room, and lots of times, I know I do and we all do, use terms which those of us who are in public office -- whether it's President, Senator, Governor, et cetera -- use, and I don't think -- understandably, the American people don't fully understand what they mean. And -- and even I -- sometimes the press has so much to cover, I'm not sure they --
You talked about the Forest Health Plan. And talk about, as I say to my staff all the time, in plain English, what's that mean. Explain a little bit what that means.
GOVERNOR GIANFORTE: Sure. So, we have many forests in Montana that have not had good stewardship. The growth has gotten to the point -- I can take you 10 miles west to the state capital in Helena and show you a federal forest where 90 percent of the trees are standing dead. They've been killed by beetle when --
THE PRESIDENT: Right. Right.
GOVERNOR GIANFORTE: And this really creates a tinderbox situation. It reduces habitat. So. very -- very little wildlife lives there. And when we get a lightning strike or a campfire out of control and a fire starts in a forest like that, we put firefighters at risk. They're very hard to control.
The state has been very proactive. We -- the state has about 5 million acres. We've been very active in being stewards of those grounds. And when we thin a forest -- this is not clear cuts --
THE PRESIDENT: Right.
GOVERNOR GIANFORTE: -- but when we thin, when we remove excess fuels, water comes back into surface streams, wildlife comes back into that community. And when wildfire goes through a managed forest, it doesn't then get into the crown. It doesn't burn as hot. We don't have the devastation. And structures aren't threatened. So everybody wins when we have good stewardship of the forest.
THE PRESIDENT: That's really important. I -- believe it or not, I knew that. But that's really important for people to get it. Because we talk about thinning out the forest. We're talking about a lot of trees, because of climate change as well, where you have bugs, insects, eating up the trees as well, making things that -- that are changing and killing the forest themselves, and they become real tinder. And it's like, you know, dropping a match in a -- you know, in -- almost like in a pool of fuel.
And so going in and cutting all that out is not the same as going in -- I'm glad you made the point of clear cutting -- going in and just --
So I -- look, we do have, and we're -- I'm hopeful that we're going to get a lot of the infrastructure plan passed and the Recovery Act that has a lot of money in here to help you all manage these forests and to have much more money in there for the -- for the Bureau of Land Management -- anyway -- to be able to give you the help you need. Because your state, which I've been through, is a magnificently beautiful state.
It's -- and, I mean -- and the thing -- you know, you -- I come from the state of Delaware. And, you know, you had -- we had more acreage burned last year than the state of Delaware and Maryland combined -- combined. For you all out in Montana, that ain't (inaudible). (Laughs.) But I want people to get a sense of how massive -- how massive these fires are and how they affect water systems and --
Anyway, but that's -- I'm sorry to take your time, but I wanted you to be able to explain that so people understand that are listening to this.
Let me ask you -- let me ask you, Governor Inslee: You know, you've been talking about the impacts of environmental change for a long, long time. And one of the things -- and I asked him to show me -- to get me a map of where all your fires are in your state. And when you have Delancy and Cub Creek 2 and Cedar Creek -- I mean, they're massive fires. Massive.
And what are -- you know, as you look at what's transpired over the past month and you look at the road ahead of this wildfire scene, what is your biggest concern, Jay? What is your biggest concern? And again, I ask you the same question: What is the thing we can do most? I mean, you go all the way from Delancy down to ""Lil' Crick,"" as they say -- in the Creek -- you know down in the southwest -- southeast part of your state. What are -- what are your biggest concerns?
GOVERNOR INSLEE: Well, first off, thanks for your leadership, Mr. President. It is so refreshing to have a President who really cares about the Western Forest.
My biggest concern might surprise you because all of the governors share these immediate concerns. We have a huge need for additional aerial assets, additional dozer bosses so we can get our dozers into fire lines. We need new tra- -- more trained people. We do have an emerging concern about our fuel supply for our aerial assets. Everything we need to fight forest fires is in dire need across the Western United States, not just in Washington State. We've had a thousand fires. It's burned four times more at this time of year than normal. We've had two and a half times more acreage burn in the last decade than the previous.
So those are the obvious concerns. And everything you need to fight a fire, we -- we could use your help on. And I think you've been totally on top of this, and so I thank you for your leadership on all of these things, including management issues. There's unanimity, there's bipartisan acceptance of the need for active management. We're acti- -- we're managing our forests, just like Montana is, to try to get in and reduce fuel.
But here's the surprising thing, when you asked me this question, or the thing that I worry most about: The thing I worry most about is if, for some reason, the Congress did not follow your leadership in this reconciliation and infrastructure bills that allowed you to realize your vision of creating millions of jobs while fighting climate change. That's my biggest worry right now. Because the fact of the matter is there is nothing in human intervention against these fires while climate continues to ravage our forest.
You know, we used to think of these things are forests. They really, now, just fields of fuel, and they're fields of fire with just one spark because they're so dry. And that aridity creates something like gasoline on the floor of our forest.
There is only one way to prevent these forests from being gone in the la- -- in the next century effectively, to be totally unrecognizable, and that is to succeed in following your vision in the reconciliation bill for a clean energy standard, for a huge transition to the electrification of our transportation fleet, to a civilian climate corps.
And so, I want to tell you we are going to be with you, as you stand tall, while you negotiate this reconciliation bill to say, ""Look, we have to have those climate investments. There is only one way to save these forests from the ravages of climate.""
Our own federal scientists have said that if we accept a one-degree centigrade change, we'll have 600 percent increase in these fires on a regular basis. We won't recognize these forests as forests anymore unless we succeed with your vision.
So when you start having those discussions with Mr. Klain and Steve Ricchetti and everyone else at the end of the reconciliation process, you got to know you're going to have an army behind you standing tall for those things.
Now, there's some other small things that I'm talking to your staff about, about having better independent assistance for towns like Malden that burned down. There's some other coordination.
THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
GOVERNOR INSLEE: But that's the thing that's going to ultimately decide whether these forests survive in the next century.
Thanks for your leadership, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you for saying that. But, you know, one of the things that I say to all your colleagues: When I -- when it was proposed to me by some folks that we should have a Civilian Climate Corps of thousands of young people trained to do these things and -- at first, it didn't -- you know, I said, ""Yeah, yeah, that sounds good."" And then I started looking at it.
And the truth of it is, it's not fundamentally different, in terms of the help it can provide across the board training a lot of these -- I'm talking about thousands of young people getting paid to be trained and trained well for a very -- it's not -- it's not fundamentally different than the Civilian Corps put together in the Depression that was -- had a different purpose. They were building a building. They were doing a whole range of things.
But I just think I'd encourage -- and also, we'll send it to all of you. But all you governors -- Democrat, Republican -- take a look at it and see if you think I'm -- you know, I may have -- you know, as my mother would say, my eyes are bigger than my stomach. You know that I may have a bigger appetite.
But I -- I really think it can -- can be helpful. And there -- again, I say to your colleagues, there's a lot of money in here to be able to deal with your immediate needs as well.
But, anyway. Thanks, Jay. And I'll get -- I know you have this, but I want to get --
GOVERNOR INSLEE: Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT: -- more of it to you.
And, Gavin, I -- or, Governor, you know, I applaud your your -- your establishing the Wildfire and Forest Resilience Task Force, which I've learned is co-chaired by your Secretary of Natural Resources. I think it's a great example of being able to coordinate federal, state, local because this is getting real -- this is -- this is getting -- this is -- this needs a lot of coordination.
And I understand that PG&E, which provides electric to 17 million of your folks -- I understand they recently announced underground 10,000 miles of power lines. Is that -- is that true? And what's that going to do to the cost of energy in your state? And -- I mean, because that's expensive stuff.
GOVERNOR NEWSOM: It's a million to three and a half million dollars a mile to --
THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
GOVERNOR NEWSOM: -- underground in California. Do the math on 10,000 miles.
Of course, do the math on decades of neglect. Ten thousand miles is a drop in the bucket. They have 106,000 miles of distribution line. Twenty-five thousand just in high-risk, fire-prone areas which will only grow. That's a 10-year commitment. It's important, but I want to put it in perspective.
I also want to put something else in perspective. Your eyes, Mr. President, are not wider than your stomach. California is proving your theory. Over a year and a half ago we established the Climate Corps in this state. It's inspiring beyond words. It's also inspired the philanthropic sector --
THE PRESIDENT: It really is, isn't it? I mean, it's not a joke. It is inspiring when you see it. I mean, it's incredible, I think. But --
GOVERNOR NEWSOM: Absolutely. And it's the one thing this country needs more than anything else, and that's common experiences and to focus on the things that bind us together, not just divide us.
This transcends politics. We have kids from urban and rural parts of the state, across every conceivable difference, and they're advancing together in ways that truly are awe-inspiring.
So, Mr. President, that's -- that's a vision we can manifest. We're not asserting it; we're proving it.
In a small way, you have the opportunity to do it in -- at scale.
Look, I just want to briefly -- because there's so many of us -- a quick update. We're blowing past every record, and not in a good way. We're at over 5,700 fires year-to-date. We suppressed 59 just yesterday with some initial attacks. Over half a million acres already burned in California.
To put in perspective -- a record-breaking year. Last year, we were at 130,000 acres burned. We're at 504,000 as I speak to you today.
Here's the answer to your question. And forgive me for being so pointed again, respecting your time, but I want to be a little bit more specific.
Jay referenced it obliquely. Please pay attention to this fuels issue. We had to get our National Guard to get some emergency fuel supplies for our aerial fleet a week ago. This is a major issue, and it's not just impacting our aerial suppression strategies on the West Coast. It's increasingly, as you may know, impacting commercial aviation. It is a major issue.
Number two, we just simply need more boots on the ground. We can't do without you. We've got 7,400 people -- 7,400 already. We're not in fire season. Fire season in California is late September, October, into November. We're in July. We already have 7,400 personnel actively working to suppress fires.
Last year, the federal government asked us for over 5,000 mutual aid support that we could not provide. That gives you a sense of what the federal government wanted from California last year to send to other states. That should give you a sense of how far behind we are with federal support.
We have four DC-10s, Mr. President. Four. Now, DC-10s aren't the answer to every problem. They don't fly over 35 knots. They have restrictions; there are legendary restrictions. But the reality is there is four for the country, and we're competing. They're all contracted. We compete with you. We compete with other states. We don't even have access right now to DC-10s.
We lost that 747 -- that iconic 747 -- that now has been converted to a cargo plane. You've seen that in Australia, not just across the West Coast. That's now been grounded by a private contractor.
We are the largest civil aviation fleet for firefighting in the world -- California. We do not come close to having the tools in the air that we need. We need your support to su- -- to dramatically increase the aerial support, in addition to boots on the ground.
Final two quick points: Every year, we're competing -- and you have a lot of legislators that have been doing heroic work in Democratic states, governors -- and Republican states -- trying to get access to the Pentagon satellite technology for early detection. It's been a game changer for us. And we're getting it on a year-to-year basis, but it's hard. Every year, we fight to get a one-year extension on that access to a critical tool of technology.
I'd encourage you to help us so we're not just fighting every year for something that I think you would support and the Pentagon, at the end of the day, final analysis will approve.
But here's the final thing, and it's the elephant in the room. I was with Governor Sisolak two days ago in his state of Nevada. The reason why is we had a fire that was on federal property. Fifty-seven percent of the forest property in California is federal, just three percent under California jurisdiction. Three percent. Fifty-seven percent under U.S. Forest Service. U.S. Forest Service is spectacular. We have deep admiration and respect, but there's a culture that, too often, is, ""Wait and see."" We can't afford that any longer. This was a federal fire. They waited. And what we saw is the fire took off because we didn't put enough initial assets.
Greg was making an oblique point here. I want to be a little bit more explicit: We need your help to change the culture, in terms of the suppression strategies, in this climate, literally and figuratively, to be more aggressive on these federal fires.
That fire bled into Nevada and, obviously, impacted not just our two states, but deeply impacted the redundancy of this concern that comes out every year around jurisdictions and incident command and the imperative that we're all on the same page, in terms of those initial attack strategies.
So, forgive me for being longwinded, but I wanted to get those clear --
THE PRESIDENT: No, no that's -- that's why we're doing this. I want to find out what -- what's the greatest concerns you have.
And I will -- when this meeting is over, I will be on the phone with the Department of Defense and talking about the access to satellite capability.
And -- but -- I'm looking down the list here. All right, I will follow up with you, Gov -- or the Vice President will; she has a mild interest in California -- with all the points you just raised, and I -- and I do appreciate it.
Now, I want to get to each one of you, but we're going to ask the -- I think now is the time the press is going to leave the room. Am I correct?
(Press is ushered out.)

Remarks on Efforts to Combat the Spread of the COVID-19 Delta Variant and an Exchange with Reporters
","
THE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon. Today, I want to talk with you about COVID-19.
Maybe the best way to start is: In a significant part of the country, you wouldn't have to take one of these off, you don't have to put one on -- like in my home state of Delaware, where I lived in New Castle County, where I was yesterday in Pennsylvania -- because people got vaccinated. They got vaccinated. They don't need a mask when the majority -- the vast majority of people got vaccinated.
Now, look, I want to talk about what's really happening -- what it means, what it doesn't mean, and what we need to do this week and the months ahead.
From the moment I was elected, I said I'd always give it to you straight from the shoulder, and we need some straight talk right now. Because there's a lot of fear and misinformation in the country, and we need to cut through it with facts, with science, with the truth.
So, what's really happening today?
After months and months of cases going down, we're seeing a spike in COVID cases. They're going up. Why? Because of this new form, this new variant called the ""Delta variant.""
This is a much different variant than the one we dealt with previously. It's highly transmissible, and it's causing a new wave of cases in those who are not vaccinated.
Our experts tell me that cases will go up further
before they start to come back down. But while cases are on the rise, they're not -- we're not likely to see, according to experts, a comparable rise in hospitalizations or deaths in most areas of the country.
So, you have to ask yourself: Why is that? Because 164 million Americans are fully vaccinated, including 80 percent of those most vulnerable -- our seniors.
So, there's a challenge, as we knew there could be. But there's also good news.
We've spent the last six months preparing for this possibility. The vaccines are highly effective. We have enough vaccine for everyone to get vaccinated.
And thanks to the American Rescue Plan and the hard work of the American people, we've administered over 325 million vaccination doses in the past six months.
We have the tools to prevent this new wave of COVID from shutting down our businesses, our schools, our society, as we saw happen last year.
I've said from the beginning that we will be guided by the science. So here's what the science tells us:
On Tuesday, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention -- the CDC -- announced its new mask recommendation in parts of the country where COVID cases are substantially high, where people didn't get vaccinated -- which they define as 50 new cases for every 100,000 people in a week.
The CDC recommends you wear a mask when you're in public and indoors, like work or in a grocery store. That's true for both the vaccinated and the unvaccinated. Why? Because even if you've been fully vaccinated and protected from severe illness from COVID-19, you could have the Delta variant in your system
and spread it to someone who isn't vaccinated.
We need to wear masks to protect each other and to stop the rapid spread of this virus as we work to get more people vaccinated.
And I hope all Americans who live in areas with substantial or high case rates will follow the mask guidance that's being laid down by the CDC. I certainly will. And I have -- because this is one of those areas, in Washington.
And at my decision -- at my direction, all federal personnel and visitors to federal buildings will have to do the same thing.
As I've said from the beginning, a mask is not a political statement; it's about protecting yourself and protecting others. Masking is one defense against the spread of COVID-19.
But make no mistake: Vaccines are the best defense against you getting severely ill from COVID-19 -- the very best defense.
And you want to know how we put this virus behind us? Well, I'll tell you how: We need to get more people vaccinated.
Look, and it's important to understand what vaccines do and what they don't do. Put simply, the vaccines are designed to save lives and prevent severe illness. They're highly effective at both.
A hundred and ninety million Americans have had at least one shot. Of that group, about 90 percent are done now, and 10 percent are waiting for the second shot.
To those folks who have one shot but not the second: Go get the second shot. Even if you're overdue for the second shot, it is not too late. Go get the second shot now. Now.
The bottom line is: If you're fully vaccinated, you're highly protected from COVID-19. But I also know that many of you who are vaccinated are concerned about what's called ""breakthrough cases."" Yes, some fully vaccinated people will still test positive, and some will show some symptoms of COVID-19. That's expected with almost every vaccine there is for other diseases.
But breakthrough cases remain rare and almost all are mild cases. In fact, virtually all hospitalizations and deaths are among the unvaccinated.
I also know many of you are wondering if you'll need a booster shot to add another layer of protection. As of now, my medical advisors say the answer is no. No American needs a booster now.
But if the science tells us there's a need for boosters, then that's something we'll do. And we have purchased the supply -- all the supply we need to be ready if that was called for.
Folks, the truth is, as more people get vaccinated, we are better protected as a nation to continue reopening safely and responsibly.
But we are not fully out of the woods yet, because what is happening in America right now is a pandemic -- a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Let me say that again: It's a pandemic of the unvaccinated.
There are about 90 million Americans who are eligible to get the shot but haven't gotten it yet. As I just mentioned, nearly all of the cases, hospitalizations, and deaths due to COVID-19 today are from unvaccinated people.
Last month, a study showed that over 99 percent of COVID-19 deaths had been among the unvaccinated -- 99 percent. This is an American tragedy. People are dying and will die who don't have to die. If you're out there unvaccinated, you don't have to die.
Read the news and you'll see stories about unvaccinated patients in hospitals. As they're lying in bed, dying from COVID-19, they're asking, ""Doc, can I get the vaccine?"" And the doctors have to say, ""Sorry, it's too late.""
Right now, too many people are dying or watching someone they love dying and saying, ""If I just got vaccinated, if I just…"" It's heartbreaking. And it's complicated even more because it's preventable.
America is divided between the majority of eligible people who are vaccinated and those who are not. And I understand that many of you in the majority are frustrated with the consequences of the failure of the minority to get vaccinated.
But I want you to know that I'm going to continue to do everything I can to encourage the unvaccinated to get vaccinated. That includes addressing hesitancy and misinformation head on.
For example, I know some of you are -- who are unvaccinated think, ""The development of vaccine was rushed, therefore I'm not going to take a chance. As a result, I think it's not safe because it was rushed."" I understand.
But let me explain. Our top scientists at the National Institute of Health -- the NIH -- and across the country got to work applying decades of research -- decades of research -- let me repeat that: decades -- that have already been done -- the research -- to develop the COVID-19 vaccine when it hit.
In the last six months, more than 325 million doses of the vaccine have been administered in the United States and billions of doses administered around the world. The vaccine was developed and authorized under a Republican administration, and has been distributed and administered under a Democratic administration.
The vaccines are safe, highly effective. There's nothing political about them. Look at all the people who took a shot at it. They later -- we learned a lot of them have already been vaccinated.
From the start, I have to compliment Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. He hadn't made it political. He's encouraged people to get vaccinated and is continuing to do so, and his state is in pretty good shape.
Alabama Republican Governor Kay Ivey recently spoke out to encourage vaccination.
And even the commentators on Fox who have been belittling this for a long time -- some haven't, but many have -- are arguing, ""Get vaccinated.""
Look, this is not about red states and blue states. It's literally about life and death. It's about life and death. That's what it's about.
You know -- and I know people talk about freedom. But I learned, growing up at school and from my parents, with freedom comes responsibility. Your decision to be unvaccinated impacts someone else.
Unvaccinated people spread the virus. They get sick and fill up our hospitals. And that means if someone else has a heart attack or breaks a hip, there may not be a hospital bed for them.
If you're unvaccinated, you put your doctor and nurses at risk -- the same frontline, essential workers who put their lives on the line over the past year and have gone through hell.
Again, with freedom comes responsibility. So, please, exercise responsible judgement. Get vaccinated -- for yourself, for the people you love, for your country.
I'm being literal when I say this: As I travel the world, almost every day a foreign leader calls me, asking can I provide his or her country more vaccines. Their people are desperate for vaccines.
I'm doing everything to answer those calls. We're sending millions of vaccines to people around the world. But, folks, it's an American blessing that we have vaccines for each and every American. We've made it our first and top priority to have available vaccines for every eligible American and that's never going to change as long as I'm here.
And it's a shame -- it's just such a shame to squander that blessing. That's why after six months of extraordinary work and effort, today I'm laying out additional steps we should be taking to deliver these lifesaving vaccines to more Americans.
First, we're going to provide more incentives to encourage unvaccinated Americans to get vaccinated. That starts with paid leave to get the shot. We're still hearing that people are unable to get time off from their employer to get vaccinated. Well, this is unacceptable.
For some time now, I've said you should be able to get the shot and still get paid. Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, the federal government is fully reimbursing any small- or medium-sized business that provides workers with paid time off to get vaccinated.
Employers, this costs you nothing. If you haven't given employees paid time off, do it now, please.
Today, I'm announcing that we're taking this a step further. The federal government will now reimburse those employers to give their staffs -- who give their staffs time off not only to get themselves vaccinated, but also to get their family members vaccinated.
That means employers can get reimbursed if they give parents time off -- with paid time, paid leave -- to take their kids or their own parents to get vaccinated. So, I'm calling on all employees [employers] across the country to give paid time off to get the shot or to help a family member do so. I promise you: It will cost you, the employer, nothing. You'll be reimbursed.
Secondly, I'm announcing that we'll continue the work -- to work with states to encourage unvaccinated people to get vaccinated. In February, the grocery store chain Kroger's offered $100 to their associates if they'd get vaccinated. And it worked. Vaccination rates moved up from 50 cent [sic] -- 50 percent to 75 percent among their employees.
States like New Mexico, Ohio, and Colorado are offering similar incentive programs that have helped increase vaccination rates.
So, today, I'm calling on all states and local governments to use funding they have received, including from the American Rescue Plan, to give $100 to anyone who gets fully vaccinated.
I know that paying people to get vaccinated might sound unfair to folks who've gotten vaccinated already, but here's the deal: If incentives help us beat this virus, I believe we should use them. We all benefit if we can get more people vaccinated.
But in addition to providing incentives to encourage vaccination, it's time to impose requirements on key groups to make sure they're vaccinated. (Clears throat.) Excuse me.
Just this week, we took an important step to protect our veterans. Like many civilian hospital systems are doing, the Department of Veterans Affairs will now require COVID-19 vaccines for doctors and nurses and other healthcare workers who provide medical care for our veterans.
We must do everything possible to protect our veterans from getting COVID when they come to get medical care they so richly earned serving their country. We owe them.
Next, since many vaccinations are required for active duty military today, I'm asking the Defense Department to look into how and when they will add COVID-19 to the list of vaccinations our armed forces must get.
Our men and women in uniform who protect this country from grave threats should be protected as much as possible from getting COVID-19.
I think this is particularly important because our troops serve in places throughout the world, many where vaccination rates are low and disease is prevalent.
Next, every federal government employee will be asked to attest to their vaccination status. Anyone who does not attest or is not vaccinated will be required to mask no matter where they work; test one or two times a week to see if they have a -- they have acquired COVID; socially distance; and generally will not be allowed to travel for work.
Likewise, today, I'm directing my administration to take steps to apply similar standards to all federal contractors. If you want to do business with the federal government, get your workers vaccinated.
Look at the Chamber of Commerce representing tens of thousands of American businesses. The National Association of Manufacturers. The Business Roundtable, which is comprised of the largest and biggest corporations in America. They're all applauding the actions the federal government is taking, and I urge them to follow suit.
I also commend the National Football League that has announced that if there are outbreaks among unvaccinated players and personnel, then the team risks forfeiting games. I urge other sport leagues at every level to take every step they can.
Every day, more businesses are implementing their own vaccine mandates. And the Justice Department has made it clear that it is legal to require COVID-19 vaccines.
We all want our lives to get back to normal, and fully vaccinated work places will -- will make that happen more quickly and more successfully. We all know that in our gut. With incentives and mandates, we can make a huge difference and save a lot of lives.
I also want to speak to families with children in school. We can and we must open schools this fall full time. It's better for our children's mental and emotional wellbeing, and we can't afford another year out of the classroom. Every school should be open, and we're giving them the tools to be able to do so safely. Even in those areas where they have a higher vaccination -- they have a higher rate of COVID.
Through the American Rescue Plan, we've provided schools billions of dollars to implement safety measures: better ventilation, social distancing, and other measures.
In March, when vaccinations were scarce, I prioritized teachers and school workers by utilizing our Federal Pharmacy Program. Almost 90 percent of educators and school staff are now vaccinated.
Additionally, the CDC has provided clear guidance on how all schools can safely protect the kids and bring them back to the classroom: every student wear a mask. It's that simple.
So, we've funded safety measures at schools, we've vaccinated teachers and staff, and we can mask up our kids for further protection.
But once again, there's one more thing we need to do: Get more adolescents, ages 12 and up, vaccinated now that they've been cleared. In the past week, the good news is we're seeing the average number of 12- to 17-year-olds getting vaccinated go -- increase 22 percent per day.
Today, I'm asking school districts to host one last pop-up vaccination clinic over the coming weeks for kids ages 12 and up. We're directing the Federal Pharmacy Program to help make that happen.
Parents, get your children vaccinated. You do it for so many other things right now.
And for kids under 12, if and when the vaccines are deemed safe for them, we'll be prepared to get the vaccines administered as quickly and as safely as possible.
Look -- and as we work to vaccinate more Americans, we're prepared for outbreaks in areas of -- where there are unvaccinated people.
My administration has made it clear to every governor that more federal resources are available to them. This includes the deployment of surge teams composed of ex- -- experts from the CDC and the Federal Emergency Management Agency -- the FEMA.
We're going to continue to provide states with more testing, treatments, protective equipment, personnel, mobile vaccination clinics to stem the surge of the virus among the unvac- -- unvaccinated.
The pictures of hospitals in several states overloaded with patients is unnecessary, avoidable, and tragic. You know, we'll help any health system overloaded and unable to cope with a spike in cases. We're ready to do that.
Let me close with this: If you're at home and vaccinated but anxious or even angry, or if you're at home and unvaccinated, unbothered and unconvinced, let's step back and see where we are.
Just remember how we've emerged from a dark winter into a hopeful spring and summer. But really remember just how dark that winter was.
Over 3,600 Americans were dying each and every day. And now, even with the surge among the unvaccinated, we're down to that -- 300 Americans a day. Significant.
Millions of people were out of work, out of homes, out of hope, and going hungry. Remember those long lines of people in their automobiles waiting for a box of food to be put in their trunk?
Experts and pundits said we couldn't get the vaccines. And even if we could get the vaccines, we couldn't get them in people's arms and couldn't get them vaccinated. They predicted our economy would collapse. But remember how we stayed focused and how we went to work?
In six months, we got 164 million Americans fully vaccinated. And because we vaccinated so many people, put in place so many safety measures, and got economic help to businesses and people most in need, our economy is recovering.
More than 3 million Americans are back to work since I was sworn in -- a faster job growth than any previous administration. Any.
We're experiencing the fastest economic growth in nearly four decades. The best in the world as of now.
In fact, today's GDP numbers show that in the first half of the year, our economy grew faster than any point in nearly 40 years. Our economy grew more in six months than most Wall Street forecasters expected for the entire year before we implemented our plan.
And just yesterday, we announced a bipartisan infrastructure deal that's going to continue this momentum over the long term by making the most significant investment to rebuild America in nearly a century.
But we still have to face many challenges. We still have a lot of work to do as we readjust to a post-pandemic economy. But we have the right plan. We're coming back. We just have to stay ahead of this virus.
I know this is hard to hear. I know it's frustrating. I know it's exhausting to think we're still in this fight. And I know we hoped this would be a simple, straightforward line, without problems or new challenges. But that isn't real life. We're coming out of the worst public health crisis in 100 years, the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.
As I told you before, I carry a card in my pocket -- I hope I have it with me -- I have -- carry a card in my pocket with the number of Americans dead from COVID-19. As of today -- this morning -- the total deaths in the United States were 609,441. Granted, the death rate per day is way down; it's down to 400, about, dead.
But that's more deaths than World War One, World War Two, Vietnam, 9/11, Iraq, and Afghanistan wars combined. This is as tough as it gets.
We're Americans. When we get knocked down, we get back up. That's who we are. That's what we do. That's why there's no nation on Earth like us.
And we're prepared like never before. We have the tools to save lives, to keep our economy growing and growing and going.
After the past six months, following the science, we know we can dramatically lower the cases in this country. We can do this. We brought our economy back to life, and we kept it going. We know we can send our kids back to school. We know we can beat this virus. We can do this. We all just have to do our part.
My fellow Americans, this nation has never failed when we have come together as the United States of America. So I say to all those who are unvaccinated: Please -- please get vaccinated.
And to the rest of America: This is no time to be despondent or let our guard -- our guard down. We just need to finish the job with science, with facts, with the truth. And together, as Americans, we're going to be able to beat this.
May God bless you all. May God protect our troops. Thank you.
Q: Mr. President, how long do you think it might be necessary to wear masks? And at what point do you think people might have to have a booster shot? Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT: I said it in my talk: The booster shot is not needed now. It is possible that it will be needed later. I don't know -- they don't -- the science hasn't dictated that yet. And the fir- -- first part of your question?
Q: How long do you think people might have to wear a mask again?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, if you notice, a lot of places, people don't have to wear masks. Let's get that straight. The places where people have gotten vaccinated, where we have a high vaccination rate, people do not have to wear a mask at all.
Like some of you were with me yesterday when I was up in Lehigh Valley. Didn't have to wear a mask there. Don't have to mask if you come home to Delaware with me -- I know you love doing that. But you don't have to wear a mask. The places people are probably going to have to wear masks: in those communities where the high rate of unvaccinated stays high and they don't move -- they don't move to getting vaccinated.
But I think you're going to find the patience of businesses and the patience of a lot of other people running thin. Because the fact is, if you had high vaccination rates, you -- we wouldn't be in the spot right now.
Yes.
Q: Mr. President, will this set up a -- an American workplace for federal workers and private sector that really is the vaccinated versus the unvaccinated? And is that a pressure you're trying to harness now?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, no, I'm not -- look, what I'm trying to do is keep people safe. I mean that sincerely.
So, if in fact you're unvaccinated, you present a problem to yourself, to your family, and to those with whom you work. Because as pointed out -- I was asked the question about, ""Why would people who have already been vaccinated get it?"" Well, you got anywhere from 2 to 3 percent, on average -- the last study done -- that can still get COVID. They don't get very sick. They don't get hospitalized. It's not serious, but they can catch it.
And the concern is they may be able to pass it on. And so, that's all being studied right now. But it's important -- thing is, if people are vaccinated, the transmission rate drops through the floor. And that's all we're trying to do.
Yes.
Q: Mr. President, thank you. Why not push for vaccine mandates in states, private companies, schools? Do you want to see those entities pass vaccine mandates?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, I -- I'd like to see them continue to move in that direction, and that's why I point it out. I had asked the Justice Department to determine whether that is -- they're able to do that legally, and they can. Local communities can do that. Local businesses can do that.
It's still a question whether the federal government can mandate the whole country. I don't know that yet.
Q: Mr. President, you said, earlier this week, that we are not headed back towards lockdowns. But if the science is evolving, how can you be so confident in that? You heard -- we heard you saying, weeks ago, that ""the virus [was] on the run,"" but Dr. Fauci has also indicated that we are headed in the wrong direction.
THE PRESIDENT: Well, look, you're take -- you're literally correct on everything you said, but it doesn't make -- come to the conclusion you're implying.
It is clear that if everybody is vaccinated, the existing vaccines work to prevent death, serious illness, hospitalization. Okay? If every -- so, if tomorrow I can wave a wand and every American was vaccinated, then in fact we'd be out of the woods.
Now, can something else happen a year from now? Can there be a different virus? Can there be something? It's possible. But I'm talking about COVID and the existing variants that have come forward so far.
So, it makes a -- it's a simple proposition: If you're vaccinated, you find yourself in a situation where you are -- highly unlikely, even if you somehow get the virus; very small percentage do -- that you are not going to be hospitalized, you're not going to be on a ventilator, you're not going to be sick, but you could be in a position to possibly spread it to someone who wasn't if you have it in you.
Yes.
Q: Mr. President, thank you. I wanted to ask: Why not require that the people show proof that they're vaccinated? And also, if you could just -- with the 4 million, how much of an impact do you think this will have? Do you have a projection, sir?
THE PRESIDENT: A projection on what?
Q: On how many people will get vaccinated by putting in this system?
THE PRESIDENT: No, I can't -- I'm not going to get in business of projecting -- I -- exactly how many people are likely. All I know is that we go through these periods, then we run up against a wall, then something happens where people realize, ""Oh, my lord, this is really a problem,"" and they begin to see things.
Look, the fact that a lot of your friends are now saying, ""Get vaccinated,"" who were -- before were saying, ""This is not a problem. This is all a Democratic thing."" With a small ""d"" and a capital ""D."" I mean, there's a lot changing. People are becoming aware. The more aware they become, then we have these surges of people going out and getting vaccinated --
Q: But what about requiring proof --
THE PRESIDENT: -- and it just keeps building.
Q: I'm sorry, sir.
THE PRESIDENT: What about what?
Q: What about requiring proof, sir?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, that is -- there's two ways to do it, and I think you're going to see some institutions doing that. Like you're going to fly abroad, you got to -- you're going to have to have proof. You're not just going to be able to say, ""Yeah, I got tested."" You got to pri- -- provide proof.
My guess is: If we don't start to make more progress, a lot of businesses and a lot of enterprises are going to require proof for you to be able to participate.
In the back. And then I'm going to take off, shortly here.
Q: What further actions are you going to take to encourage private businesses to follow this type of model to either require vaccines or require testing or other preventative procedures?
THE PRESIDENT: I just did. And I'm going to keep at it. I'm going to be talking about it around the country. I'm --
Q: Are you -- but are you going to reach out to private businesses, meet with them, try and actively encourage them to follow this model?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, I have. That's why we have folks from the -- everyone from the Chamber of Commerce to the manufacturers, et cetera. So, you know, I am -- am I going to call a meeting of every, you know, business in the country to come to Washington? And -- or go on --
I have made the case repeatedly. I doubt whether there's a single, solitary business that doesn't understand that I think I think it's smart for them to require testing, require -- and if you -- if you can't demonstrate, you can't prove you've been vaccinated, you have to be tested.
Q: Secretary Austin said he was already considering mandating --
THE PRESIDENT: Yep.
Q: -- the vaccine after it was fully approved. Would you like to see the mandate go into effect before full approval? And do you think he's open to that?
THE PRESIDENT: I know he's open to it. And the question is: When is the right time to get the most bang for the buck when you do it? A lot of this is timing. And so, I think it's going to happen, but I -- look, the one thing that you all are politely and appropriately referencing is that it's still a temporary approval. So when does the final approval come? It usually takes a lot of -- a lot of work to get -- to get there.
I made a commitment I would not tell anyone in the Justice Department who they should prosecute and I would not tell the health industry that they -- excuse me, the government health entities what they should say and do. But my expectation is they're going to reach that conclusion in the early fall.
Thank you very much.
Q: Mr. President, one more. Mr. President, you said -- Mr. President, you said -- Mr. President, you said, ""If you are fully vaccinated, you no longer need to wear a mask."" And it seems --
THE PRESIDENT: No, I didn't say that.
Q: You did. I have the quote.
THE PRESIDENT: I said if you're fully vaccinated in an area where you do not have -- well, let me clarify it.
Q: In May, you made it sound like a vaccine was --
THE PRESIDENT: Well, in May, that's true.
Q: -- the ticket to losing the mask forever, and it --
THE PRESIDENT: That -- that is true at the time, because I thought there were people who were going to understand that getting vaccinated made a gigantic difference. And what happen was: A new variant came along, they didn't get vaccinated, it was spread more rapidly, and people -- more people were getting sick. That's the difference.
Q: How is the First Lady, sir?
THE PRESIDENT: I'm going to find out in a minute. That's why I'm leaving.

Remarks on the Importance of American Manufacturing in Macungie, Pennsylvania
","
THE PRESIDENT: Well, I'm not going to say anything; I just came to drive a truck. (Laughter.) And I'm not sure which one I want to drive. That one? There's one back in the corner you can't see. It's the biggest damn pick-up truck you ever saw in your life. (Laughter.) I tell you what.
Please, everybody have a seat. Everybody have a seat.
Carlo, thank you. And, Carlo, I'm sorry about your mom. I really am. So many -- so many people. Well over 630,000 Americans have lost their lives because of COVID. And the only thing I'm going to -- and the press keeps wanting me to talk about COVID, but I'm going to mention this one thing.
We still have a lot of people not vaccinated. The pandemic we have now is a pandemic of the unvaccinated. So, please -- please, please, please, if you're not vaccinated, protect yourself and the children out there. It's important.
And, Carlo, having been a significant consumer of healthcare myself and my family, I've often said this, and I mean it from the bottom of my heart: Thank your daughter for me. If there are any angels in heaven, they're male and female nurses. Not -- that's the God's truth. Doctors let you live; they make you want to live. Spent a lot of time in ICU, with my son on a table. Tell her, ""Thank you, thank you, thank you."" I really mean it. (Applause.)
And I want to thank Congresswoman Wild for the passport into her district. Where are you? (Applause.) As they say up in Scranton, she's bragging on y'all. They don't say ""y'all"" up there; they say that in Delaware. (Laughter.) You do because you got family from Alabama.
And you've been a tireless champion for the working men and women of the Lehigh Valley, helping us pass a tax cut for families with children that people are seeing now in their bank accounts, showing up in their bank accounts every month, and working with our administration to expand home care for seniors. We got a generation that's a ""sandwich generation"" between the child and a mom or dad needing help. And they need help. Provide better pay for caregivers.
And I want to particularly thank Bobby Casey -- he's a great friend of mine -- who champions this cause in the Senate for eldercare.
You know, John Mack started this iconic American company in 1890. But things didn't really didn't get off the ground until four years later when he brought his William -- his brother William down from Scranton. (Laughter.)
So, it goes to show you: If you want to get things moving, bring a guy from Scranton to get it going. (Laughter and applause.)
Mind if I take my coat off? I'm going to take my coat off.
You know -- and, folks, we're getting things moving. We really are. You are.
When I started my campaign for President -- and the Gov is still -- Gov, I didn't introduce you. I apologize. No, you're the governor of this state, and you're one of the best governors in the country. Thank you. (Applause.) And you're a good friend.
When -- when I said I was running when I announced my campaign -- and not many people took it seriously -- I said I was running for three reasons: one, to restore the soul of this country -- a sense of decency and honor; but, secondly, to rebuild the backbone of the country: hardworking, middle-class folks who built this country. And I want to point out: Unions built the middle class. (Applause.) That's not a joke. Unions built the middle class.
And, by the way, in case you regret anything, I just want you guys and women in union know that if it weren't for the UAW in 1972, I never would have won. You think I'm kidding. We had the largest percentage of union workers of any state in the nation in Delaware back then, including Michigan, because we're a small state and we had big plans. But, so -- so, before you get upset, remember, you're to blame why I got here. (Laughter.)
Look, folks, I think a lot of us come from similar backgrounds: moms, dads, brothers, sisters, family. People who get up every day, work hard, raise their families, pay their taxes, serve their communities, and serve their country.
And that's why I moved so quickly to pass the American Rescue Plan shortly after I got in -- elected. (Applause.) Because we needed to act quickly and boldly to save jobs, save businesses, and save lives. And we did.
We added more than 600,000 jobs per month since I've taken office. That's over 3 million jobs all told. (Applause.) It's the fastest job growth at this point in any administration on record because of you all.
We brought this economy back from the brink: checks in people's pockets, shots in people's arms, tax cuts for working families with children. And we designed our strategy not only to provide a temporary boost, but to lay the foundation for a long-term boom that brings everyone along.
Because when I arrived in office, we had a long time -- it's been a long time since the federal government had worked hard for working people. Things had been great for big corporations, great for the very wealthy, folks at the top. Those 55 major corporations for the past three years paid zero in federal taxes, making over $40 billion. They had no complaints.
But when I put my hand on that Bible on January 20th and took the Oath of Office, I made a commitment to the American people: We're going to change the paradigm so working people could have a fighting chance again to get a good education, to get a good job and a raise, to take care of that elderly parent and afford to take care of their children, and stop losing hours of their lives stuck in traffic because the streets are crumbling, or waiting for slow, spotty Internet to connect them to the world.
That's what the economy we're building is all about. Because given half a chance -- and think about this; I mean this from the bottom of -- given half a chance, ordinary Americans -- the people have never, ever, ever, ever let their country down, just given a half a chance. (Applause.) I mean it.
You may have heard that, in Washington -- and I was just on the phone -- it looks like we reached a bipartisan agreement on infrastructure -- a fancy word for bridges, roads -- (applause) -- transit systems, high-speed Internet, clean drinking water, cleaning up and caffing [sic] -- capping the orphan wells, over thousands of them abandoned, and abandoned mines -- and a modern, resilient electric grid to build.
And guess what? A lot of those abandoned wells are leaking methane. And guess what? The same union guys that dug those wells, they can make the same union wage capping those wells. (Applause.)
And I'm working with Democrats and Republicans to get this done, because while there's a lot we don't agree on, I believe that we should be able to work together on the few things we do agree on. (Applause.) I think it's important.
In addition to the physical infrastructure, I also put forward a thing called Build Back Better plan, with investments that are going to really -- if I said to you, ""You could have the following: We're going to be -- build you a lot of new roads and bridges, or I can make sure we're going to educate your kids so we're the best educated population in the world,"" what do you think would most impact on the growth of America? You'd be the most educated nation in the world. So I'm insisting that we have universal pre-kindergarten, two years of free community college. (Applause.)
All the studies show: No matter what background a kid comes from -- whether they're a single mom, a single dad who is on what we used to call ""welfare,"" are in trouble, or come from a middle-class household -- the kid who comes from the background that's deprived is going to hear, by the time they get to first grade, a million fewer words spoken. A million fewer spoken. What that means is they're behind the eight ball from the start. And a lot more.
But we found out if you put kids in not -- not daycare but in school at age three, four, and five, it increases by 58 percent the chance, no matter what their background, they'll make it through high school and qualify to go on to community college.
Folks, we need more affordable childcare. There are a lot of women not working today because they can't get -- go back to their jobs because they have no one to take care of their children; they can't afford it.
I was a single dad for five years when my wife and daughter were killed in an automobile accident, my two little boys were badly banged up. I commuted back and forth to Washington because I couldn't dare leave and move to Washington because I didn't have my family to help me take care of my kids. I was making a good salary -- $42,000 a year then. And guess what? I couldn't afford care -- daycare for my children.
Eldercare: How many of you know somebody, has a mom or dad that needs help just because they're getting older and maybe still has their home but would rather stay in their home, increase their mental state, put them in a position where it's better for their health, but you can't figure out how to keep mom home alone, how to do it -- or dad? Well, eldercare is a big piece of this.
Paid leave: We're one of the only industrial countries in the world that you don't get paid leave if you have a sick son, daughter, mother, father, wife, husband, to have some time to take care of that.
Bring more people into the workforce, enhance our productivity, raise wages, and bring down the cost for working families.
You know, I was born up in Scranton, and my dad worked up in Scranton. He was actually from Baltimore, but he worked in Scranton and met my mom (inaudible) dad moved there.
And when coal died, everything died in the Valley, so he had to leave and look for a new job. My dad used to have an expression when we got down to Wilmington. First thing he did -- he got a job scrubbing the inside of boilers for a thing ca- -- often called ""COW"" -- the COW corporation.
We finally got to the place where -- we get to the place after five years we could afford to buy a small house -- actually, six years. My dad used to say, ""Remember, Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about your place in the community."" I give my word to what he'd say. And it's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, ""Honey, it's going to be okay,"" and mean it.
Because we know that trickle-down economics has never worked. But when working families do well, everybody does well, including the wealthy. Everybody. (Applause.)
Today, I'm here to talk about a commitment that's sacred to me and central to our efforts to keep things moving. It's a straightforward solution: support and grow more American-based companies. (Applause.) Put more Americans to work in union jobs. (Applause.) Strengthen American manufacturing and secure critical supply chains. And confront the climate crisis, which is all about jobs.
I can sum it up in two words: Buy American. (Applause.) Buy American.
You know, what most people don't know -- no matter how informed they are, most people don't know that for literally almost a century, there's been a law on the books in America called the Buy America Act. It's supposed to make sure that when your government spends your tax dollars in buying goods that they have to be goods that were built, purchased in America.
But the previous administration didn't take it so seriously -- in previous ones, not just the last one. They were quick to say, ""You know, we have a lot of money to spend. We got to buy -- the government is going to buy everything from buildings to aircraft carriers to trucks to whatever it is. But we can't find an American company that can do it all, so we're going to have to issue a waiver. We'll hire the American company, but that American company is going to have a subsidiary overseas where non-American -- Americans don't work, where it's much cheaper, they can make more money, and they're going to say, ""We have to have that as part of the chain of building the product.""
The result has been tens of billions of dollars didn't go to jobs and businesses in communities like this one.
In recent years, ""Buy American"" has become a hollow promise. But my adma- -- my administration is going to make ""Buy American"" a reality. And I'm putting the weight of the federal government behind that commitment with Made in -- in the White House itself, we put in a Made in America Office to oversee -- not in an agency, in the White House itself -- to oversee these efforts.
In my first Cabinet meeting, I told all of the Cabinet members if their agency wants to issue a waiver -- they're buying forest -- the Forest Department is buying trucks or hoses or whatever they need, okay? They've got to buy something that's -- all of it has been made in America.
And you can't give exceptions. Because if you say, ""We can't find one that does -- has…"" They get their nozzles overseas because they don't have anybody here who can make them, et cetera. I said, ""If you're going to give an exception, you got to tell the White House specifically why the exception.""
If they still want a waiver, they have to post the request on -- publicly so American manufacturers all over the United States -- and businesses -- have a chance to look up now in a new facility and say, ""Hey, they're for companies that make nozzles. They're looking for companies that make the following whatever. We make that. We make that."" And contact us. Then they can't take the job overseas.
And today, we're going to go further: We're going to make the biggest enforcement changes to the Buy American Act in 70 years.
Right now, if you manufacture a vehicle -- I expect you guys know about that -- that gets purchased by the federal government, the law says that -- and there's about 600,000 vehicles the federal government owns, by the way, and replaces and buys -- that ""substantially all"" of that vehicle -- ""substantially all"" should be made in America.
But because of loopholes, over time, you know what ""substantially all"" means today? If 55 percent of it was made in America, you can go ahead and get all of the rest of it purchased other places. To me, 55 percent is not ""substantially all;"" it's barely half.
And this is actually a double whammy. First, 55 percent is not high enough. And second, contractors don't have to tell us the total domestic content of their products, they just have to tell us that they hit the threshold. Nobody checking. Well, they got a new sheriff in town. (Applause.) We're going to be checking. No, I'm serious. I am deadly earnest.
Today, I'm directing the Budget Office to issue a rule to raise the amount of domestic content required to be considered Made in America from 55 percent to 75 percent. (Applause.) ""Substantially all"" is going to mean substantially all.
And starting with critical products, instead of taking contractors at their word that they hit the threshold, we're going to start making them give us the details so that we can do more to support American manufacturing.
We want to be the ones making the innovative parts of every product -- the ones that will support more jobs and more small businesses.
For example, I had a tour today. A lovely lady showing me in the parts where -- the second stop we made -- she said, ""Well, we're having a little problem. We're finding we don't have the computer chips that we need to go into the engines, et cetera."" We basically don't make them anymore in America.
So, I got together with a group of 20 Republicans and Democrats. We passed a new piece of legislation providing that South Korea and Taiwan open up plants here in the United States hiring American employees to make those computer chips so we're not held hostage. (Applause.)
In case you haven't noticed, not only you but Ford Motor Company said they're going to have to stop producing certain vehicles. They couldn't get the chips. Couldn't get the wafers.
And so I'm also directing my Budget Office to create new rules for critical products where we know we need stronger, more resilient domestic supply chains. We're talking about components like semiconductors, pharmaceutical ingredients, advanced batteries, among other things.
We saw during the early days of the pandemic that the supply chain disruptions can put Americans' lives and livelihoods at risk.
When we needed them most, we were short of protective equipment, we were short on ventilators and other essential health equipment. We couldn't get the job done. We couldn't take care of people. We were short on basic equipment.
I know a lot of you in this factory stepped up to make PPE at the time. That was a noble service, but it's not a long-term solution.
Yes, we'll keep trading with our allies, but we need to have a resilient supply chain of our own so that we're never again at the mercy of other countries for critical goods ever again. Ever.
You know exactly what I'm talking about. Right here, you've seen production slowdowns. As I've said, you've had your hours cut because of the shortage of computer chips and semi-conductors.
These chips are in more than just vehicles; they enable so much of our modern lives -- our smartphones, our televisions, our medical equipment.
That's why we're investing $50 billion to have the best chip manufacturing in the world come and build factories in the United States of America. (Applause.) And it passed the Senate, and it's called the CHIPS Act, and it's part of my Build Back Better plan. And it is bipartisan, as many Republicans are concerned about it as Democrats.
It's not just semiconductors. With this rule, we'll be able to buy medical products from companies like OraSure that are up -- that are down the road in Bethlehem -- or up the road in Bethlehem, I should say. I'm used to thinking from Scranton.
Their COVID-19 tests are being made right here, bringing good jobs along with it -- meaning that we're developing a homegrown capacity to respond to this pandemic and help prepare for the next one.
And, by the way, when I say ""Buy in America,"" I mean from all America. You know, we're going to include communities that have historically been left out of government procurement, when more contracts are going to go Black and brown communities, Native Americans, small businesses, every state and territory, every industry that services and manufactures, and also agriculture.
Part of the problem is that a lot of companies don't even know these opportunities exist to be part of this. And we've got to -- and we got to know -- I used to have a great friend -- a friend who's a great friend. He used to play for Providence College back in the days when they had great teams. His name was Pete McLaughlin, and he used to have an expression. And he wasn't the -- God love him. He passed away -- needed a heart (inaudible).
But anyway, the point is that what Pete used to say -- and academics weren't his thing -- he used to say something very streetwise. He said, ""Joe, you got to know how to know."" You got to know how to know. You can walk into the Library of Congress, one of the greatest libraries in the world, and if you don't know how to use the card catalog, figuratively speaking, it's just all happenstance. You got to know how to know.
So we started a new manufacturing contracting office in the Small Business Administration to help small- and medium-sized businesses bid on these contracts. And my Department of Commerce is working to help government agencies connect with new domestic suppliers in every state. That's how we're going to build a future that's made in America.
One more reason this is going to make a big difference: Each year, the federal government purchases more than $600 billion in goods and services. The Congress passes laws for purchasing things, and as President, I get to decide where we spend them and what we purch- -- what -- I mean, I purchase what was called for, but I get to -- and I'm the one who makes the decision -- the administration makes a decision on how to spend that $600 billion.
If American companies know that we're going to be buying from them, they're going to be more inclined to hire and make key investments in the future in their companies, like you're doing here.
My Build Back Better plan has incentives for electric vehicle adaptation [adoption], for increasing the amount of clean energy our government buys. And these Buy American rules can help guarantee a reliable market.
I just saw the work you're doing on the heavy-duty electric vehicles here, like electric garbage trucks. You know, there are more than 600,000 vehicles in the federal fleet, including the majority of -- the largest portion of which are at the post office.
As we work to electrify them -- as they run out, electrify them -- we're going to be making a market for vehicles with electric, supporting both the good jobs being created, as well as innovation we need to electrify our transportation sector and clean up our environment at the same time.
And we'll be expanding my Made in America initiative to help cities, towns, and Tribes get a better deal when they buy a ""Made in America"" product. It helps the towns, the taxpayers, as well as all of you on the floor of this significant place. It really does.
There are a lot of folks out there who look at how fast and how dramatically the world is changing and world economies are changing. I mean, who would have thought that 20 years ago you'd be making electric garbage trucks here? Seriously, think about it. But they accept it as gospel that working folks aren't going to -- aren't -- are going to get left behind; they're not going to be able to keep up.
Just the opposite. It's the opposite. Hardworking Americans are the ones who are going to make it happen. We got to invest in you. We have the most productive workforce in the world here. Given half a chance, there's not a single -- single thing you can't do.
So, I reject out of hand -- I've been criticized for this for some time -- but I reject out of hand this defeatist view that the forces of automation and globalization mean we can't have good-paying union jobs in America.
And right here, on this factory floor, you're making a product that are fighting climate change. That's why when I hear ""climate change,"" I think jobs.
Our manufacturing future, our economic future, our solutions to the climate crisis are all going to be made in America, creating good jobs. This's what it means to build back better.
We came out of this economic crisis -- the worst since the Depression -- stronger than when we went in.
America is one of the few countries of the world -- when we get smacked and knocked down, we get up, we come back, and we come back better than we were before we got knocked down. Now, I'm not joking. Think about the -- you know, the course of history in America.
And that's why, in the American Rescue Plan that we passed shortly after I took office, we're investing considerable sums that will go to cities and towns looking to build back stronger.
For example, towns in the southwestern part of this state can now apply for funds to cap those wells that are leaking methane, clean up abandoned coal mines, invest in bringing new employers into abandoned factories, and get help attracting them.
Let me close with this: Back in 2009, during the so-called ""Great Recession,"" the President asked me to be in charge of managing that piece -- then-President Trump -- excuse me, Freudian slip; that was the last President. He caused -- anyway, that was -- President Obama, when I was Vice President.
And the American auto industry, you remember, was on the rocks. And a lot of people, including a lot of Democrats, thought it wasn't worth investing tra- -- investing in them because the American worker wasn't that good, and they were blah, blah, blah.
I remember the heat that I took -- some of you may remember as well -- when I stood up and stepped into the rescue of the American automobile industry. My name was often taken in vain on television shows a lot, because ""Why is Biden so committed to the automobile industry?"" Well, because the fundamental mistakes that were made weren't made by the workers; they were made by management.
Today, a lot of the folks who said we shouldn't rescue the American auto industry are the same folks who are saying, ""We don't need to buy American."" What those people never realized is, if you give an American worker just a chance -- a fighting chance -- there's nothing they won't do. And if you give American companies and communities the chance, there's nothing they can't build. Just look around.
From the steel that raised our cities to these trucks behind me that are going to carry the economy forward, to the workers who are the heart and soul and spine of this nation -- American strength is here. It's in this region. It's you. It's not hyperbole. It's you.
And that's why I've told every foreign leader -- and I just got back from Europe meeting with heads of state. One said to me -- I said, ""America is back."" And he said, ""For how long?"" A head of state. And I said, ""You know, I want to tell you something: It's never, ever, ever been a good bet to bet against America. We never fail when we decide we're going to do something.""
So, today, I'm placing my bet on America. I know you all are going to make sure it pays off because it will pay off with good jobs, long-term employment, the ability for America to, once again, reassert its role as the most powerful economy in the world. And that is as important as the size of our military and as anything else we do. And if we think we're not in a race, well, guess what? Take a look at China. Take a look at China.
I spent an awful lot of time with Xi Jinping, President of China -- more than, I'm told, than any other world leader has. And he's made it really clear he doesn't think democracies can compete in the 21st century. And I spent over 25 hours alone with him over the period of the last five years -- seven years.
And guess what? Just come back from a conference with Putin. He thinks the same thing. Well, I got news for them: Autocracies will not succeed if we do what we can do as a democracy. Democracies.
And if you noticed, not a joke, a lot of the rest of the world is hedging their bets whether to move toward autocracy or stay with democracies.
We have it all, folks. We have everything that we need in this country to -- not only today, but for my grandchildren -- to be in a situation where we're still the most powerful physically and most powerful economic nation in the world that treats other nations decently and maintains the peace. That's who we are. That's America.
We're the most unique nation in the history of the world. Not a joke. By that I mean: Every other nation was put together based on ethnicity or religion, geography -- but not America. America is the most unique nation in the world, and literally, we're based on the ide- -- an idea. An idea is what formed America. And the idea was -- and it sounds corny, but it is absolutely true -- no other nation has this as their organizing principle: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men and women are created equal…endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights…life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.""
We believe it. We've never accomplished it, but every generation that moved us closer and closer and closer to inclusion. That's why America's real power is not in the exercise of a military power, but people follow us because of our example. That's why the rest of the world follows us.
It was about time we get back up and reassert who we are. This is the United States of America. (Applause.)
Thank you, and God bless you all. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

Remarks at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and an Exchange with Reporters in McLean, Virginia
","
THE PRESIDENT: It's an honor to be here. I guess you all are the ones that lost the lottery, huh? (Laughter.) You had to be here in person.
Well, I'd like to thank Director Haines and Director of the National Counterterrorism Center, Christy Abizaid, for showing me around the watch floor.
Folks, the main reason I came -- and I mean this sincerely -- is to say thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. The American people, almost by definition, are not able to know what you do. And you devote so much of your time, your effort, and many of you end up risking your lives in the Intelligence Community to do things to make sure that your families and people back here are safe -- make a difference.
And you'd be amazed -- as I traveled the world as Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee or member of the Intelligence Committee for all those years, or as Vice President of the United States dealing with national security issues, or as President of the United States -- how many of now my foreign counterparts thank you for what you do.
I'd like to introduce you, by the way, to my National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. Jake, would you stand up? (Applause.)
And, you know, the leaders of many of our intelligence agencies are here today. And I thank you for your diligence and keeping our country safe, and your commitment to supporting your teams. Because, if there's anything, a team sport is what y'all are doing if there's going to be anything that's going to be accomplished.
Because the people I most want to honor and thank today are the intelligence professionals whose names the public is never, ever going to know, never have any notion of what you've done for us: the analysts; the linguists; the collectors and field officers; scientists; support staff; so many others who are real experts, whose careers started much longer before my administration and whose service to our nation is going to extend well beyond my presidency.
You know, you're the eyes and ears around the world -- in the frontlines of our national defense, and in many cases, for the world, through us. And you serve the American people no matter which political party holds power in Congress or the White House. It's so vital -- so vital that you are and should be totally free of any political pressure or partisan interference. That's basic.
And I want to be absolutely clear that my administration is getting us back to the basics. To the basics. I promise you: You will never see a time, while I'm President of the United States, when my administration in any way tries to affect or alter your judgments about what you think the situation we face is. I'll never politicize the work you do. You have my word on that. It's too important for our country.
Getting back to basics also making -- to make sure the IC scrupulously acts within the legal constraints and abides by our strong traditions of internal and congressional oversight, including respect for whistleblower protections.
And it also means understanding that much of the work you must do is in secret but necessary and for the sake of safety. But we should strive to be as open as possible with the American people about the nature of the threats we face and just how serious they are -- and they are.
Every one of you joined up because you believe in being part of something that's bigger than yourself, especially you guys and women in uniform -- bigger than yourself. You're patriots. It's a word that we use lightly, but I mean it. It's not -- it's not -- I don't use it lightly. I really don't.
My son, who spent a year in Iraq and died, he was a patriot. He wasn't just somebody else. You all are patriots. You risk your lives and your sacred honor for all that we need to have done for us.
And you believe in the American idea. And living up to that idea is embracing democratic values that are our greatest strength at the end of the day, leading not just by the example of our power, but by the power of your example. The power of your example.
In addition to thanking you for your bravery, integrity, and your sacrifices, I want to make it clear to everyone here today and to the members of the Intelligence Community working around the globe that you have my full confidence.
That's doesn't mean I don't question what you send me. That meant -- doesn't mean -- it's not that I -- I -- you know, I'm not a new guy on the block in terms of these issues. But one of the reasons I question is to push -- push you to the limits to determine just how certain you are about what you're doing. Lots of times, the only honest answer: ""We're not certain. We're not certain, but this is what our best judgment is.""
I know -- I really do -- know how hard the work you do is. I've been doing this for a long, long time before I became President. I know there's no such thing as 100 percent certainty in the intelligence world. Occasionally that happens, but rarely, rarely, rarely.
But I also know that your work is invaluable to our ability to make informed, strategic national security decisions. And I just had an interesting meeting, as you all know, with my very close friend, Vladimir Putin. (Laughter.) I can tell -- one thing: I've been dealing with world leaders a long, long time. And just like all of you men and women, you can sort of sense somebody else after a while.
He knows that you're better than his team, and it bothers the hell out of him. Not a joke. Not a joke. And he, as a consequence of you, think we have capacities he may even exaggerate. That's a good thing. That's a good thing.
You know, one of the things I miss most during the four years between my time serving as Vice President and being a professor in a college -- and I mean this sincerely: From the time I was 31 years old, every morning I woke up and got in the train to come to -- I commuted every day from Delaware after my wife and daughter were killed. And I'd come every day, and one of the things I would get -- I'd get a brief in the morning. And I was more informed than 99 percent of the American people. You know what I miss most, for real, from those four years of being a professor? The PDB. (Laughter.) No, you think I'm joking. I am not. A sense of knowing where all the pieces were. Whether we had it all down, we knew where all the pieces were. We knew where the pieces were.
And so now I have access again -- and to the chagrin of many of you, I read it in detail. (Laughter.) And I ask questions of my briefers and follow up with my team. And I ask each of you the same thing I asked Director Haines, ""Just give it to me straight."" I'm not looking for pablum; I'm looking for straight-from-the-shoulder assessments. And when you're not sure, say you're not sure. But give me your best judgment of what you think is -- your best judgment is better than almost anybody else's judgment in the whole world -- even if the news is hard, even if the news is bad.
I can't make the decisions I need to make if I'm not getting the best unvarnished, unbiased judgments you can give me. I'm not looking to hear nice things. I'm looking to hear what you think to be the truth.
I greatly appreciate just how much work goes into the analysis that the IC produces and the tactical and intelligence supporting our warfighters and the superb effort to ensure our IT, our human capital, and the facilities are the best in the world. Because, again, without knowing what -- without you telling me, I don't know enough to know what to ask for from the Congress -- how much money we need, what we need to focus on.
It's a massive, coordinated, global effort to pull together reliable intelligence in a timely way. And all of you, no matter which agency you work for, are part of one team with one shared mission: keeping America strong and secure in the world, or simply making sure your families are safe. It gets down to basic things. Just really basic things.
You know, for most of the last 20 years, much of the work has been focused on counterterrorism, making sure the United States doesn't experience another horror like occurred on September the 11th. And that work has to continue and evolve to address the changing shape of terrorism as we find it today.
And that's no great insight on my part, it's going to change significantly more. It's going to change significantly more.
I always get kidded by my colleagues when I served in the Senate for 36 years for quoting Irish poets. They think I quoted Irish poets because I'm Irish. That's not the reason I quote them; they're simply the best poets in the world. (Laughter.)
And there's a famous poem written by -- that says, ""All has changed, changed utterly. A terrible beauty has been born."" The world is changing so rapidly -- technologically and in terms of alliances and human intercourse -- that war is going to change across the board in the next 10 years than in the last 50 years. That's not hyperbole; that's a fact.
If I talked to you 15 years ago about hypersonic flight, you'd look at me like I was crazy. So much is going to change and that's going to put an enormous burden on you to stay ahead of the curve. It's really going to get tougher.
But we have the best folks in the world. And one of the things that I think -- and I don't want to get off too far afield here, but one of the things that is really important is -- our greatest strength, in fact, is our diversity, bringing completely different perspectives to it. And I really mean that. That's not hyperbole. I'm not trying to be ""Kumbaya, everybody get along."" It's just a fact. It's a fact.
And so, threats that are more geographically dispersed than they were 20 years ago are going to continue to require our vigilance. And we have to continue our efforts to better understand some of the hardest and most important intelligence targets we face as a nation.
But, you know, we also need to make sure that we're positioning ourselves to stay ahead of security challenges that will stretch the IC in new ways it has never been stretched before.
You know, we've seen how cyber threats, including ransomware attacks, increasingly are able to cause damage and disruption to the real world. I can't guarantee this, and you're as informed as I am, but I think it's more likely we're going to end up -- well, if we end up in a war, a real shooting war with a major power, it's going to be as a consequence of a cyber breach of great consequence. And it's increasing exponentially -- the capabilities.
When I was with Mr. Putin, who has a real problem -- he is -- he's sitting on top of an economy that has nuclear weapons and oil wells and nothing else. Nothing else. Their economy is -- what? -- the eighth smallest in the world now -- largest in the world? He knows -- he knows he's in real trouble, which makes him even more dangerous, in my view.
Take a look at China. I've spent more time with Xi Jinping as a world leader than anyone else has. I spent 25 hours alone with him when I was Vice President because it was important that, according to President Obama, that someone knew who the new guy coming on board was, and it couldn't be the President.
I traveled 17,000 miles with him. I've sat with him, with me and just an interpreter -- each of us have a simultaneous interpreter. He is deadly earnest about becoming the most powerful military force in the world, as well as the largest -- the most prominent economy in the world by the mid-40s -- the 2040s. It's real.
I don't know. We probably have some people who aren't totally cleared -- I don't know, but you saw just what we found out about hypersonic -- we -- anyway, as they say in Southern Delaware, ""This boy has got a plan."" And, you know, we better figure out how we're going to keep pace without exacerbating and moving us in a position where we increase the hostilities unnecessarily.
I think we also need to take on the rampant disinformation that is making it harder and harder for people to access -- assess the facts, be able to make decisions.
In today's PDB you all prepared for me, look what Russia is doing already about the 2022 elections and misinformation. It's a pure violation of our sovereignty.
Now you see what's happening. More people get their information from the Internet than they do from any other outlet. What's -- all the disinformation that's having real consequences in terms of people's access.
And so, there's so much that you all -- particularly those of you who are new and coming along -- are going to have to be -- keep up with and ahead of in ways that are not even happening now, as good as everything is.
You know, as we compete for the future of the 21st century with China and other nations, we have to stay on top of the cutting-edge developments of science and technology.
If you'd hold for a second here, I want to point out something. You know, we used to -- we used to be, when I first got here as a U.S. senator, actually three and a half decades ago, we invested more money -- R&D -- money in R&D as a percent of our GDP than any nation in the world. We're now number eight. China was number nine; they're now number two. It matters. It matters.
Look at where we are on things that intelligence communities and others don't even think very often about -- about how educated the public is. We're coming around right now. This doesn't relate to the intelligence community per se, but it does.
Think about it. If we were having the debate that was taking place in the United States in the late 1890s and the early 1900s about public education, do you think any of us would say 12 years of free public education was enough to compete in the 21st century? Not a joke. Think about it. What do you think? I don't think there's a shot if we were doing that today.
So the fact we have the best-educated public in the world -- well, that's our objective -- will matter a great deal. It will matter a great deal. It is as much a part of national defense, in my view, as anything else is.
So I think we have to think differently. I don't expect you to agree with me. I expect you to at least understand where I'm coming from because the world is changing so significantly.
And it's especially important that we work closely with our partners and allies to maintain our technological edge; shore up supply chains; ensure that the rules that govern technologies support democracies, not autocracies.
You know, at the same time, we have to work in cooperation with nations like China and Russia that are our competitors -- and possibly mortal competitors down the road -- in the context of there's -- to meet the existential threats, for example, of climate change. There are certain things that are in our mutual interest. But we can't -- we can't be lulled into thinking that that's enough and that we don't really have to keep a watchful eye on what the ultimate objective of the other team is. But there are things where we should be -- where we should be cooperating.
This shared danger impacts all of nations. Climate challenges are already accelerating instability in our own country and around the world: extreme weather events that are more common and more deadly; food and water insecurity; sea levels rising, resulting in changing climates and driving greater migration and posing fundamental risk to the most vulnerable of communities.
If you could hold for just a second again. We're in a situation where -- think about this. Think about this: I'll never forget the first time I went down in the tank as Vice President, after I got elected. The Defense Department said what the greatest threat facing America: climate change.
If, in fact, the seas' level rises another two and half feet, you're going to have millions of people migrating, fighting over arable land. You saw what happened in North Africa. What makes us think this doesn't matter? It's not your responsibility, but it's something you're watching because you know what's going to happen.
People who were Muslim, and the only difference was Black and/or Arab, killing each other by the thousands for arable -- a piece of arable -- arable land in North Central Africa. But what happens -- what happens in Indonesia if the projections are correct that, in the next 10 years, they may have to move their capital because they're going to be underwater?
It matters. It's a strategic question as well as an environmental question.
A dramatically warming Arctic is opening up competition for resources that once were hard to access. I had -- as they say in Southern Delaware -- they talk at you like this, you know what I mean? -- I had a ""Come to Jesus"" meeting, an ""altar call"" with Mr. Putin about what he thinks is what Russia's property is in the Arctic. China looking very closely at that as well, where they are.
That's what I mean about the world changing. What is that going to do to our strategic doctrine in the next 2, 5, 10, 12 years, when you can circumvent the Arctic without icebreakers?
So, look, we need your insight, we need your expertise on all these issues. The one thing you all have in common is you all have high IQs. You're all smart. You have significant intelligence quotients, and you put it to use to help the elected leaders in this country decide what the best route to go is.
So just as you always have been essential as we've sought to counter traditional threats, the Intelligence Community is going to be critical to America's strength as we take on these new challenges and hybrid threats.
Finally, I've laid out a broad agenda, and that's just a fraction of it. But we can't do any of this without taking care of our best and most important asset: the American people.
I know the intelligence community is already one of the best places to work in the federal government. I asked my staff when I found out you came in second just after NASA -- I said, ""Don't tell me what the White House is ranked."" (Laughter.) ""It will hurt my feelings."" And they assured me, no, you don't rank them. That was a good thing: ""We don't rank the Oval Office."" (Laughter.)
But all kidding aside, it's about the comradery you have, and most of all, it's about being able to trust one another -- to trust one another.
My highest priority as President is the safety and security of all Americans, and that includes those who serve in our Intelligence Community.
You take on unique risks in these jobs, and we're taking the cases of anomalous health incidents that are affecting intelligence officers, government officials, and their families very seriously, for example.
My administration is coordinating a government-wide effort to respond to these incidents, because this challenge demands -- demands that departments and agencies, including the entire Intelligence Community, work together with urgency.
Talked about changes. What's going to happen as we move on and we're able to develop around the world pathogens that can be transmitted to societies and communities? It may not be a nuclear weapon. It may not be a hypersonic missile. It may not be any of the things we think of.
But think about it. Just think about what's happened with one -- I'm not suggesting it was intended -- a lot more we need to know -- but think what's happened: More people have been killed in the United States of America because of COVID than in every single major war we fought combined. Every single one. What's next? What is intended? There's a lot of research going on. You're going to find -- you're going to have to increase your ranks with people with significant scientific capacity relative to pathogens.
So, my point is: Your value is going to increase and increase and increase and increase in terms of security. You know, from the CIA to all the agencies, there's a lot that's going to happen.
And to all of you who've been affected, we recognize how important it is to make sure that they have the best possible care at a time you're figuring out how to deal with what's happening, not only to some of those who have been stationed abroad, but their families.
Look, this is a priority for our entire leadership team. So let me just close by saying how much I value the work you do. That's why I wanted to come here today.
So much of the work you do is in secret. It means many, many times you don't get credit -- the credit you deserve -- and the things you prevented from happening, the catastrophes you've enabled us to avoid, the judgments you've provided us to make our people safer.
And America is probably never going to learn about the lives you've saved or the disasters that never come to pass because of your diligent, professional intelligence work. But I want you to know I know. For the time being, at least as long as I'm around, I know.
And on behalf of the American people, thank you all for what you do every single day. And we're grateful -- we're grateful that you're there for us. We're safer because of your dedication, your honesty, your integrity, and your significant intellectual capacity to act in our interest.
We're stronger because of your insight. We're a more noble nation because of your insight. And American lives have been saved repeatedly because of your insight. I know it may sound like hyperbole, but from the bottom of my heart, I thank you. I thank you for all you do and continue to do.
And may God bless you all. And may God protect our troops and all those patriots serving in harm's way, because there's a lot still there. Thank you, thank you, thank you. (Applause.)
I have to seek permission to leave. I had to check, if you noticed. (Laughter.) Thank you again. (Applause.)
Q: President Biden, will you require federal employees to get vaccinated?
THE PRESIDENT: Beg your pardon?
Q: Will you require all federal employees to get vaccinated?
THE PRESIDENT: That's under consideration right now. But if you're not vaccinated, you're not nearly as smart as I thought you were.
Q: Are you concerned that the CDC's mask guidance could sow confusion?
THE PRESIDENT: We have a pandemic because of the unvaccinated, and they're sowing enormous confusion. And the more we learn -- the more we learn about this virus and the Delta variation, the more we have to be worried and concerned. And only one thing we know for sure: If those other hundred million people got vaccinated, we'd be in a very different world.
So, get vaccinated. If you haven't, you're not nearly as smart as I said you were.
Thanks. (Applause.)

Remarks Prior to a Meeting with Prime Minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi of the Republic of Iraq and an Exchange with Reporters
","
PRESIDENT BIDEN: Well, I'm honored to welcome the Prime Minister. We've known each other for some time. And welcome to the White House, welcome to the Oval, Mr. Prime Minister.
Iraq has been a vital part for the -- partner of the United States for some time now in the Middle East. And we've en- -- I've engaged deeply in Iraq for my entire career back in the Senate, as Vice President, and as President. And I've worked with Iraq to -- and matter of fact, my son Beau was in Iraq for a year with the Am- -- with the Army National Guard.
And the sacrifices that so many -- so many have made to build the U.S.-Iraq partnership has been real, and it's consequential. And my administration is committed to strengthening that partnership, Mr. Prime Minister.
And the U.S-Iraqi Strategic Dialogue is about commitments that expand our cooperation on issues like healthcare, climate, energy. For -- matter of fact, I wanted to tell you: I was told you -- the half a million -- 500,000 -- doses of COVID vaccine we're sending -- I was told you were told they wouldn't come for a while. They'll be there in a couple of weeks.
PRIME MINISTER AL-KADHIMI: Thank you.
PRESIDENT BIDEN: They'll be there quickly. And -- and, you know, we support strengthening Iraq's democracy, and we're anxious to make sure the election goes forward in October. And we're also committed to our security cooperation. Our shared fight against ISIS is critical for the stability of the region. And our counterterrorism cooperation will continue, even as we shift to this new phase we're going to be talking about.
I'm looking forward to consulting with the Prime Minister today. We have a lot to talk about. He's been a good friend. And I'm anxious to get going.
Floor is yours, sir.
PRIME MINISTER AL-KADHIMI: Thank you, Mr. President. It's a great honor to be here today with our American friends. We have strategic partnership. I'm happy to be here in Washington to discuss the future of our nation and how to improve this relation between our two countries.
America, they help Iraq. Together we fight to defeat Daesh -- ISIS. And I'd like to thank the American people on behalf of all Iraq's people.
Mr. President, I thank you for all the blood and treasure that America has given for a free and democratic Iraq.
Today, our relation is stronger than ever. Our partnership exists for economy, the environment, health, education, culture, and more.
I'm looking forward to work with you, Mr. President, to bring our two countries more closer for benefit of Iraq and United States.
God bless our two countries. Thank you, Mr. President.
PRESIDENT BIDEN: Thank you. Thank you, folks.
(Cross-talk by reporters.)
PRESIDENT BIDEN: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa. Hang on a second. If you want to talk about Iraq, ask me a question about Iraq.
Q: How many troops would you like to see in Iraq by the end of this year? And how does the relationship changes, considering this is the last strategic dialogue that you have with Iraq and the Prime Minister?
PRESIDENT BIDEN: This most recent dialogue you mean.
Q: Correct.
PRESIDENT BIDEN: Well, we've been talking a lot. Our foreign ministers, our Cabinet members have been talking. We're looking forward to seeing an election in October. We're working very hard with the Iraqi government to make sure the U.N. and the GCC are -- we have oversight; that there's -- these are full and fair elections.
I've been in -- I've been in contact with Kadhimi. I have -- anyway, I think things are going well. Our role in Iraq will be as a -- dealing with not -- it's just to be available, to continue to train, to assist, to help, and to deal with ISIS as it -- as it arrives. But we're not going to be, by the end of the year, in a combat mission.
Q: Mr. President, Veterans Affairs. Mr. President, Veterans Affairs is going to have a mandate for its healthcare --
PRESIDENT BIDEN: You are such a pain in the neck, but I'm going to answer your question because we've known each other for so long. It has nothing to do with Iraq.
Q: I take that as a compliment, Mr. President.
PRESIDENT BIDEN: (Laughs.) I'll answer your question. Yes, Veteran Affairs is going to, in fact, require that all docs working in facilities are going to have to be vaccinated.

Remarks on the 31st Anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act and an Exchange with Reporters
","
THE PRESIDENT: Madam Vice President, Tyree -- you're an inspiration. Thank you for sharing your story.
Thirty-one years ago today, on the South Lawn of the White House, President George H.W. Bush signed the Americans with Disabilities Act. He surrou- -- he was surrounded by disability advocates and bipartisan members of the United States Congress, just as we are today.
Speaker Pelosi -- welcome, by the way, Madam Speaker -- Chairman Leahy, Leader McCarthy, Senator Casey, Congressman Scott, Congressman La- -- where is here? There you are, Paul [Jim]. You understand this better than anybody does. And I want to thank you, Congressman, for all your work. And I want to thank you all for being here.
Second -- by the way, where's mom? Mom -- is she here?
MS. BROWN: She's at home watching.
THE PRESIDENT: Oh, she's watching.
MS. BROWN: She's watching.
THE PRESIDENT: Okay. I thought she looked -- I said, ""Mom is out there."" I was going to ask her to stand up. But, Mom, you can't stand up if you're home. But, folks -- (applause) -- give you -- thank you for what you've done.
The Second Gentleman is here as well. Thank you for being with us as well.
And some of the same folks who fought so hard for this landmark legislation are with us today. I just got off the phone with one of them -- a guy named Tom Harkin. And yest- -- or two days ago, I was on the phone with one who just had his 98th birthday, Bob Dole. (Applause.) But no one worked harder than Tony Coelho to get this done. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer.
Others weren't able to join us today but were instrumental in bringing this to life -- dear friends, as I said, like
Tom Harkin and Bob Dole.
And I also spoke -- as I said, Bob is -- wanted to pass on his regards, as did Tom. Tom is up in Wisconsin working on -- he said on ADA, doing something up there. Now, he didn't explain exactly what.
There are still more with us that are here in spirit, like Ted Kennedy, Major Owens -- Congressman Major Owens, and countless other advocates.
I was enormously proud to be a co-sponsor to the ADA as Pat Leahy was, as well, if I'm not mistaken, as a member of the United States Senate.
And I'm proud to be here today, as President, alongside so many fearless champions who represent the ongoing legacy of this law, from the foundations to its future.
Thirty-one years ago, after its passage, many Americans have never lived in a world without the ADA. Generations have grown up not knowing a time before it existed.
But many of us can still recall an America where a person with a disability was denied service in restaurants and grocery stores, and could be; where a person using a wheelchair couldn't ride on a train or take a bus to work or to school; where an employer could refuse to hire you because of a disability. An America that wasn't built for all Americans.
Then we passed the ADA and made a commitment to build a nation for all of us. All of us. And we moved America closer to fulfilling that promise of liberty and justice, and maybe most importantly, dignity and equality for all.
You know, and perhaps most importantly, we did it together. This was a Democratic bill signed by a Republican president. A product of passion and compassion, not partisanship. Progress that wasn't political, but personal, to millions of families.
I'll never forget the moment the ADA passed. And you may remember it, Pat. Standing on the floor of the United States Senate, and Tom Harkin saw the recognition -- he rose. And the first time -- first time in the history that I'm aware of -- in the United States Senate, he stood up and he signed in a speech to his brother. Tom wasn't just sending a message to millions of deaf and hard-of-hearing folks; he was speaking to his brother, Frank. It was personal to him.
It was personal to Bob Dole, as well, who lost the use of his right arm in a heroic effort during World War Two; who laid out in a hospital for almost three years -- his injury listed, and they also lasted an entire lifetime.
But like so many Americans, he turned his disability,
his apparent limitation, into greater purpose and will. He made -- he made the rights of disabled Americans a lifelong cause.
And for more than 60 million Americans living with disabilities, the ADA is so much more than a law; it's a source of opportunity, participation, independent living, and respect and dignity, the bulwark against discrimination, and a path to independence.
And for our nation, the ADA is more than a law as well; it's testament to our character as a people, our character as Americans. It's a triumph of American values.
But, of course, this law didn't bring an end to the work we need to do. Today, too many Americans still face barriers to freedom and equality. But thanks to this movement that spans all races, beliefs, backgrounds, and generations, we're once again making progress together.
In my first day in office, I was proud to sign an executive order establishing a government-wide commitment to advancing equity, including people with disabilities. (Applause.)
And I was proud to appoint the first-ever White House Disability Policy Director, Kim Knackstedt. Where are you, Kim? (Applause.) Where is Kim? Thank you, Kim.
And I'm ensuring that dignity and rights of disabled Americans are lifted up in every policy we purzue [sic] -- pursue, from continuing to make sure that this administration looks like America, appointing people with disabilities to positions across the government.
In the American Rescue Plan, we were able to include substantial support for schools that better serve students with disabilities, that -- expanding access to vaccines for disabled Americans.
As part of my Build Back Better plan -- it was already mentioned -- we propose $400 billion to expand access to home- and community-based care -- (applause) -- helping people with disabilities and older adults live more independently.
And I'm glad that Congress is beginning to move on the Better Care Better Jobs Act -- (applause) -- championed by my buddy, Bobby Casey -- Bobby, thank you -- which builds on that effort.
This past year, the entire nation saw just how vital our caregivers are and how critical home-based care truly is for so many Americans.
This legislation will help ensure that caregivers are fairly compensated for their work. (Applause.) In addition, I've also called on Congress to eliminate the discriminatory sub-minimum wage provisions -- (applause) -- that too often keep people with disabilities from getting good jobs with fair wages.
And because of additional executive orders I've signed, we're working to remove barriers that hold back disabled Americans from exercising their sacred right to vote.
And we're ensuring that the federal government is a model employer when it comes to wages, accommodations, and opportunities to advance people with disabilities. That's a firm commitment.
And today -- (applause) -- finally, I'm proud to announce a new effort -- the first of its kind -- to help Americans grappling with long-term effects of COVID-19 that doctors call ""long COVID.""
Many Americans who seemingly recover from the virus still face lingering challenges like breathing problems, brain fog, chronic pain, and fatigue. These conditions can sometimes -- can sometimes rise to the level of a disability.
So, we're bringing agencies together to make sure Americans with long COVID, who have a disability, have access to the rights and resources that are due under the disability law -- (applause) -- which includes accommodations and services in the workplace, in school, and our healthcare system so -- so they can live their lives in dignity and get the support they need as they continue to navigate these challenges.
We made important progress, but we still have work to do. We have to keep going to ensure that every single American has a chance to contribute their talents and thrive and succeed.
And I know that today's fearless advocates, some of whom are with us today, are going to accomplish incredible things.
People like -- like M- -- excuse me, people like Mr. Tootle. Where are you? (Applause.) Stand up, man. Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
You know, I want to thank you for your continued efforts to build an America for everyone, and as I said, you courageous advocates who led the way 31 years ago -- a long time before the foundation for progress is strong, though. It's part of the mor- -- moral bedrock of our nation and something every American should be proud of.
Now it's my honor to sign the proclamation on the 31st anniversary of the ADA.
I want to thank you all. May God bless you and all of you dealing with disabilities. You're -- you are an inspiration to all of us. I really mean it. You're an absolute inspiration. (Applause.)
May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Now I'm going to walk over and sign this. I'm going to invite up, though -- Nancy, come on up. Steny. I think we ought to get you up here. You were -- you're a big part of it -- Tony Coelho. Am I leaving anybody out?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Pat.
THE PRESIDENT: Pat, you -- you were there at the time. Why don't you get your rear end up here and put your -- (laughter).
The Leader is taking his camera, because Pat would rather use his camera than, I think, anything else.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Come on.
THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, come on.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Come on up.
THE PRESIDENT: Tony, you get right in the back here. You were a big, big, gigantic part of this.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Pat, come on. Get in.
THE PRESIDENT: All right. The anniversary of the Americans with Disability Act 2021.
(The executive order is signed.)
(Applause.)
THE PRESIDENT: Tony. (Hands a pen.)
REPRESENTATIVE COELHO: Thank you.
LEADER HOYER: Thank you, sir.
THE PRESIDENT: Good to see you.
Madam Speaker. Pat.
SENATOR LEAHY: Thank you, sir.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: And this hero right there.
THE PRESIDENT: I will, but I want to make sure I got all the --
(Gives pen to Ms. Brown.)
MS. BROWN: Thank you so much.
THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, everybody. (Applause.) Let's keep it going. (Applause.)
Q: Mr. President, would it be helpful if employers mandated vaccines, sir?
Q: Mr. President, do you have confidence you can get the unvaccinated Americans vaccinated?
THE PRESIDENT: We have to.
Q: How?
Q: Mr. President, are you confident there will be an infrastructure deal this week -- a bipartisan infrastructure deal?
THE PRESIDENT: You know me -- I'm always optimistic. Yes.

Remarks at a Campaign Event for Virginia Gubernatorial Candidate Terry McAuliffe in Arlington, Virginia
","
THE PRESIDENT: Hello, Virginia! (Applause.) It's so great to be back. First off, it goes without saying how much I appreciate your current governor, Ralph Northam, by the way. (Applause.) Because of the hard work of the American people, we've put ourselves in a position for us to control the virus instead of it controlling us.
Here in Virginia, COVID-19 deaths and hospitalizations are down 90 percent since January. (Applause.) Fifty-four percent of your population has been fully vaccinated, eighty-two percent of your seniors -- both of which are above the national average. (Applause.)
But this pra- -- this didn't happen by itself. It's due to the heroic vaccination program -- one of the greatest and most complex operational challenges in American history.
It happens when we all work together -- the federal government, states, cities, the private sector, and all of Americans.
Look, it happens when you have governors like Ralph who've been a key partner, coordinating FEMA and the National Guard to move personnel and resources around the state to get shots in arms. It happens when you're honest with people.
You know, I know folks are watching the number of cases rising again and are wondering what it means for them. Well, here's the truth: If you're fully vaccinated, you're safer with a higher degree of protection. But if you're not vaccinated, you are not protected.
And now -- (applause) -- what we have now is a pandemic of the unvaccinated. And, by the way -- you know the old expression -- you notice a lot of our very conservative friends have finally had an ""altar call."" (Laughter.) They've seen the Lord, whether it's on Fox News or whether it's the most conservative commentators or governors.
Thank God the governor of Arkansas -- excuse me, of -- of Alabama -- had one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country -- is now -- and I give -- I'm genuinely complimenting her --
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Stop line three! Stop line three! Stop line three!
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you, Joe!
THE PRESIDENT: That's okay. That's all right. That's all right. No, no, no, no. Let -- let him talk. No, let --
AUDIENCE: (Inaudible.)
THE PRESIDENT: That's okay. Look, this is not a Trump rally. Let them holler. No one is paying attention to them. (Applause.)
Look, here's the point: Virtually all the COVID-19 deaths and hospitalizations are today among the unvaccinated people. And I know -- I know this has gotten a bit politicized, but I hope it's starting to change. It's not about red states or blue states or guys like that hollering; it's about life and it's about death.
And I know Governor Northam is going to work like the devil to finish the job. (Applause.) Thank you, Gov.
Look -- and, of course, it's great to be with another great friend that's been around -- I've been around a long time, and I've -- seldom do I get to campaign for someone who I've agreed with more on basically everything. We go back all the way to roots in Syracuse, New York. (Applause.)
I'm talking about -- and before that, I'm actually talking about Dorothy. (Laughter.) Her roots don't go there, but -- look, she's always been there for me and Jill when we've needed her most. She was an incredible First Lady of Virginia and she will be again. She is the very best. (Applause.)
And, Dorothy, speaking of First Ladies, I'm Jill's husband. Jill wanted to be here tonight. But if you turn on your -- if you turn on the Olympics and watch Team USA, you'll see Jill Biden standing there, cheering with them. (Applause.)
The Japanese Prime Minister, who was -- I invited him to be the first person to come to the White House -- head of state -- he made it real clear: He didn't want me, he wanted her to go. (Laughter.) He is a man of incredible judgment.
Look, folks, now, of course, it's great to be with my friend and your once and future governor, Terry McAuliffe. (Applause.)
I mean this -- think about this --
AUDIENCE: Terry! Terry! Terry!
THE PRESIDENT: You got it. You're not going to find anyone -- I mean anyone -- who knows how to get more done for Virginia than Terry. That's a fact. You don't have to wonder what kind of governor Terry will be; you know what kind of governor he was and what kind of governor he'll be again.
He was a great governor of Virginia, and he'll be even greater this time because he even has more going for him. And, Virginia, you got to elect him again. (Applause.) You got to elect him again.
And I mean this: not just for Virginia, but for the country. The country is looking. These off-year elections, the country is looking. This is a big deal.
Terry and I share a lot in common. I ran against Donald Trump, and so is Terry. (Laughter and applause.) And I whipped Donald Trump in Virginia and so will Terry. (Applause.)
I tell you what, the guy Terry is running against is an acolyte of Donald Trump, for real. I mean, it's just like -- I don't know where these guys come from. (Laughter.) I really mean it.
But above all, Terry and I -- Terry, we share the same vision about delivering results and, maybe most importantly, why we got involved in politics in the first place. The very wealthy -- and I respect anybody who makes a lot of money; you should be able to be a millionaire or billionaire, whatever you want, as long as you pay your fair share. But here's the deal -- (applause) -- they don't need me to protect them.
I got involved in politics because the neighborhood I came from, the towns I came from -- Scranton and Claymont, Delaware -- little steel town -- delivering results for hardworking people, who, if you just give them a chance -- (applause) -- just a chance, they never, never let the country down. (Applause.)
You know -- I really mean that. That's not -- that's not hyperbole. I really mean it. Just, look -- I've been in office now for six months, as of a couple days ago. (Applause.) And I think -- I think the administration has a lot to be proud of.
We've vaccinated over 160 million Americans. (Applause.) We've created over three million new jobs -- more than any administration has in the first six months in entire presidential history. (Applause.) Never has it happened before.
We eliminated -- what we're on -- we're now estimated to be on track -- the economy, not growing before the recession, before COVID, said the economy would grow -- it would be three, three and a half percent. Now everything from the OECD to all Wall Street suggests that we're going to grow this economy 7 percent just this year. (Applause.) That is the highest growth in more than four decades in America. In fact, it's the best job growth in the world right now. (Applause.)
And in just the past few weeks, one of the biggest tax cuts in the history for families in American with kids went into effect this last week. (Applause.)
I've been saying -- I really mean this -- it's about time ordinary, hardworking people get a tax break. (Applause.) Because that's what it is. Parents should see that money going into their bank accounts right now. And let me tell you what it's going to mean for Americans: We're going to cut child poverty in half this year because of that. (Applause.)
Look, Terry and I share the same basic truth: Trickle-down economies never work. It's time to build the economy from the bottom up and the middle out. That's where we are. (Applause.)
And, by the way, the wealthy have never done poorly when the middle-class and the working-class people do well -- they do well.
Look, Terry understands that it started with the American Rescue Plan that's delivering immediate relief to the folks who needed it most -- folks who were on the back of their -- on heels, a lot of them knocked down.
Those rescue checks that went out to more than 80 percent of the adults and children in Virginia that provide a little extra breathing room for people.
My dad used to say -- I really mean this -- my dad used to say, ""Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck; it's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about your place in the community. It's about just having, Joey…"" -- and I mean this sincerely. When he left -- lost everything in Scranton and we moved to Delaware, he said, ""Joey, it's about a little breathing room. That's all people are asking for -- just a little bit of breathing room, a little extra room.""
Look, aid for small businesses that helps them hire and reopen there doors. I'm looking -- here it is. Excuse me. (Applause.)
Aid to cities and counties to keep their police officers and firefighters and first responders on the job, educators on the job. (Applause.)
The American Rescue Plan lowered health insurance premiums for those buying into the Affordable Care Act by 40 percent on average, saving people $600 a year. (Applause.)
And Terry knows the work continues -- that healthcare should be right, just not a privilege, folks. (Applause.)
And as I said when I was running, with Terry and Dorothy's help, it's not enough to build back. I mean this sincerely. America is the only nation in the world, when it's faced a crisis, has come back stronger than before the crisis -- the only one. I'm not joking.
We have to build back and build back better. It's amazing how that phrase has caught on around the world, isn't it? (Applause.)
But Terry and I know, along with Mark Warner and Tim Kaine and Don Beyer and Abby Spanberger -- (applause) -- who are working on this in Congress. It means modernizing our physical infrastructure.
Folks, we used to invest more than any country in the world in research and development. We had the number-one infrastructure in the world -- the best roads, highways, airports, ports.
Infrastructure is about rebuilding roads and bridges, replacing lead pipes that are poisoning our kids and the water system; delivering high-speed Internet to every single Virginian, rural and urban -- (applause); making sure ""Buy American"" -- so when we invest in the jobs, when we purchase all this, that American workers are doing the work.
It's not that complicated. It really isn't if you fight for it.
Terry and I share the belief that building back better means investing also in our human infrastructure. You know, that's my plan. It includes all the things Terry is fighting for. Terry and I believe that when we educate our children earlier, they do better. They do better. (Applause.) No matter what -- no matter what background they come from, all the studies at the great universities in this state and others have -- in the last eight years -- have pointed out that if a kid goes to -- not daycare, but preschool, beginning at age three, they increase, by 58 percent, the possibility of going all the way through school and on to community college. (Applause.)
That's why we support universal pre-K for three- and four-year-olds. (Applause.) And, Terry, if I get it done, you all aren't going to have to pay for it here in Virginia.
And, look, we believe 12 years of education is not enough to compete in the 21st century economy. That's why I want to make two-year community college available to every single American. (Applause.) We can afford to do this.
I do have one concern. My wife Jill is teaching fulltime still as a community college professor and First Lady. (Applause.) But Terry is going to be her boss again. (Laughter.) Because she teaches at Vir- -- anyway -- Northern Virginia Community College. (Laughter.)
And, by the way, Terry, since the time she started working there, she's never stopped teaching. When we got elected, she thought that she was going to continue to teach. She thought I might object. I strongly supported it. (Applause.) Teaching is not what my wife does; it's who she is.
And, folks, look -- look, the fact is that the idea that we are able to bring together people to give them great opportunities is totally within -- you know, look -- and we can afford to do this. We can afford to do this. If the very wealthy just start paying their fair share just a little bit. (Applause.)
Terry and I know -- (applause) -- how hard the pandemic has been on working families, especially women. About 2 million women are still unable to go back into the workforce during this pandemic due to things like not being able to afford childcare.
Look, when I got elected to the United States Senate, I was 29 years old. Between the time I got elected and before I was sworn in, there was an automobile accident. My wife and daughter were killed and my two boys almost died. And, by the way, I thank all firefighters. It took the Jaws of Life three hours to get them out on top of their dead mom and dead sister. You saved their lives.
And I needed help. I was a senator making $42,000 a year. I could no longer afford daycare and someone to take care of my kids (inaudible). And thank God I had a sister who is my friend, who -- she and her husband, without my asking, moved in and helped me raise my kids. My mom and my brother as well. I got lucky.
But, look, the idea, as a single mom or a single dad, working and having young children -- it's awful hard. That's why Terry and I want to expand paid leave and childcare in this country. (Applause.)
And, by the way, Terry, you and I have been talking about this for a long time. We've been talking about high drug prices -- how incredibly high they are and how we keep getting ripped off. You know, we pay more for our drugs than any major country in the world.
But here's the deal. There's a way to do it: Let Medicare negotiate drug prices. (Applause.) And guess what? All of the prices are going to come down. And it will pay for itself. I promise you, I'm going to get that done. (Applause.)
Look -- and here's the deal, Terry and I know this can be paid for. Look, we support asking the wealthiest 1 percent who got that $2 trillion tax cut that, in fact -- in fact, not a single penny was paid for -- the so-called ""Trump tax cut.""
And guess what? Just pay. Begin to pay their fair share. Corporate America -- I come from the corporate capital of the world. More corporations are, in fact, registered in Delaware than every other state in the union combined. I got elected 36 years there because I was honest with them.
Look, fift- -- right today, 50 of the biggest corporations in America of the Fortune 500 -- 50 of them don't pay -- and this is not an exaggeration; check it out -- not a single solitary penny in federal taxes. Not one. And they made over 40 --
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE PRESIDENT: No, but -- no, but I'm not doing this to get -- I just want to make it clear to you. (Laughter.)
Here's the deal: They made over $40 billion. If they just paid a minimum tax of 15 percent, they'd raise the dollars -- all we need to do all this education we're talking about here.
Look, you know -- (applause) -- when I was Vice President, the President asked me to check out what the major corporations needed the most. Along with the Secretary of Commerce, we interviewed three hundred and, I think it was, fifty-six -- it could have been forty-six -- but over three hundred and fifty CEOs and major corporations.
You know what they all said? ""I need a better-educated workforce."" Well, guess what? They're not spending any money to educate the workforce.
But if we want to make sure America succeeds and runs the world again -- economically runs and -- be the most powerful economy in the world, we should make sure that they have a chance.
These millionaires and billionaires -- I'm not one of these guys that say you shouldn't be able to be a millionaire or billionaire. But just pay your fair share. (Applause.)
Look, all told, experts in the World Bank -- outfits like Wall Street like Moody's estimate that my plan will grow the economy and create $2 million more jobs over the $16 million they said in 10 years we'd create -- good-paying jobs. Good-paying jobs. (Applause.)
A significant amount of these jobs will pay the prevailing wage of 30, 40, 50 bucks an hour. Ninety percent of the jobs in our infrastructure plan go to people without a college degree.
Folks, we're proposing a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America -- a once-in-a-generation investment in American jobs and families that's going to position us to win the competition for the 21st century.
But we've got to get it done. And I need a partner like Terry who not only is respected in this state, but is respected by governors all across America, who knows how to get it done in the states.
Folks, on his watch as governor the last time, the Virginia economy boomed. Two hundred million -- 200,000 jobs created. Unemployment went down in every single county, including rural Virginia, by nearly 50 percent.
He attracted major companies to this state. Look how your state grew. And by the way, any of you who are in the business know the first thing you try to attract a company to come to your city, your state, your town -- the first thing they ask is, ""What's the highway system? Will I have access to interstate? Is the port available? Tell me whether or not I have broadband. Tell me whether or not…"" All the things. All the things we're going to build.
You know, look, Terry worked with Republicans to invest in education, transportation, and workforce development. And, by the way, Virginia has a whole bunch of veterans and active-duty military members -- more than almost any state. (Applause.)
And guess what? The American Rescue Plan marked one of the biggest investments in veterans' health in a long, long time. (Applause.) It will upgrade VA hospitals that are 50 years old, reduce the shortages of doctors and nurses.
No veteran -- from my son who passed away on -- should pick up a phone and say, or have a wife or husband call and say, ""I need help,"" and say, ""We can't see you for a while."" We owe them immediate action. (Applause.) Immediate. It's a sacred obligation.
And I know no governor who stood up for our veterans and military families more than this guy, helping them apply their skills to good-paying civilian jobs -- fields like cybersecurity and healthcare.
He also worked with the General Assembly to fund two new veteran care centers, including the first one in Hampton Roads region, which is hard to believe.
Terry understands. He knows -- he knows also about crime prevention as a top priority.
He understands how important it is funding -- to find funding -- from the American Rescue Plan to provide law enforcement personnel with more resources, not fewer resources. (Applause.)
Look, we need to help in a lot of ways. We need to do away with chokeholds and all those things. I agree, but (inaudible) side of this is we need them to have more social workers, more veterans, more psychological help, more psychologists. (Applause.) And where it happens, it works. Personnel and resources, they keep communities safe.
And he has taken on the gun lobby to enact sensible gun safety measures without infringing on anybody's Second Amendment right, including keeping guns out of the hands of domestic abusers. (Applause.)
Here's what else: Terry is going to guarantee he's going to move to get a $15 minimum wage. Think about it, folks. Just think about it. And you -- maybe some of you, maybe you know people.
Anybody working 40 hours a week making less than $15 an hour is, in fact, living in poverty as defined by poverty in America. It should not happen, period. Period. (Applause.)
An amazing number of American people who are struggling have rental costs and housing costs that are at least 30 to 35 percent of their total income. How do you do that? How do you make it, especially if you have a child? Look, folks, housing that's affordable -- everybody is going to be in the plan.
And, like me, when Terry thinks about the climate crisis, he thinks three things: jobs, jobs, jobs. (Applause.) It is the reason why we're going to lead the world.
Let me close with this -- and I'm sorry, I'm getting kind of wrapped up in this. (Laughter.) I need him. I need him. Look, in this election and in 2022, the question the American people are going to be asking is whether or not we're helping them and their families -- not giving them anything. Are we giving them a shot -- just giving them an even shot? Do we understand what they're going through? Can we deliver for them?
As Democrats, we have to show we do understand, and we're delivering for them, and we're keeping our promises. We just have to keep making the case -- just as the Republican Party today offers nothing but fear, lies, and broken promises. (Applause.)
No, listen -- I mean, think about it -- turning on the television every day and seeing a replay of what happened on January 6th and saying, ""I was told there were a lot of peaceful, wonderful people.""
AUDIENCE: Booo --
THE PRESIDENT: God -- no, I really mean it. Think about it. It is bizarre.
We have to keep cutting through the Republican fog that government is the problem and show that ""We the People"" are the solution. (Applause.) We're the most unique country -- think about this -- we're the most unique country in the history of the world. Not a joke. Every other country is put together based on race, religion, ethnicity, background, except the United States.
The United States is based on -- the only country in the world based on the proposition that ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all women and men are created equal. Endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights."" Life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness. We've never met the test, but we've never walked away from it like the Republicans have. (Applause.)
We have never walked away. And we keep -- every administration, we keep moving that needle further and further.
Look, folks, we're going to have to go out and win -- win this thing, win races up and down the ticket. We got to protect your majority in the House of Delegates. (Applause) We got to re-elect Mark as Attorney General. (Applause.) We got to re-elect Hala as your Lieutenant Governor. (Applause.)
We got to elect Terry back as Governor. (Applause.) He's been here before. He knows what to do to. He knows how to get things done.
Virginia, we did it in 2020. In the battle for the soul of America, the people voted. (Applause.) Democracy prevailed. The Constitution held. We have to do this again. (Applause.)
I've said, time and again, no matter what, you can never stop the American people from voting. And they're trying like hell. We have to decide. The power must always be with the people. (Applause.)
Fifty -- I promise you this -- fifty years from now -- fifty years from now, our children and grandchildren will look back and know that it was at this moment America won the 21st century again. (Applause.)
And it starts now. Virginia, it starts with Terry. It starts with you. (Applause.)
God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. (Applause.) Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you. (Applause.)

Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Business and Labor Leaders and an Exchange with Reporters
","
THE PRESIDENT: Well, I'm delighted you're all here. I'm meeting with a group of labor and business leaders who -- and this is one of those meetings I've been looking forward to.
They're not here to negotiate with one another. The good news is they've been here negotiating -- not negotiating -- supporting what we're trying to get done on the infrastructure bill.
And I know that we're looking for this bipartisan effort to get this infrastructure bill passed. As you all know, and they share my belief that it's both in the interest of business and labor to get this done.
And -- and it's about -- not about energy versus environment, it's not about business versus labor; it's all about, basically, a race to the future.
I've been traveling the world lately and -- back out where I used to spend a lot of time, in the G7 and meeting with the summits with the Russians, as well as NATO. And I tell you, the rest of the world is looking to see whether we can get something done. I'm not joking about that.
The single-biggest issue -- I know you've travelled the world, all of you -- and the fact is that they're trying to figure out whether we're so divided that we can't get something done. And -- but I'm convinced that they're convinced now that we have an opportunity to make some real fundamental changes that generate growth in the future.
You know, the days used to be that we were in a position where the United States invested more money in research and development three, four decades ago than any nation in the world. Now we're number eight. And it used to be that China was -- was number nine, and now they're number two.
This is about a race for the 21st century. And you know -- and what we're doing here is, in this race for the future, it's about connecting Americans -- all Americans, rural and urban -- to high-speed Internet, repairing our roads and our bridges so that we can, in fact, no longer be ranked number 9 or 10 in terms of infrastructure in America. Back to what we used to be -- we used to lead the world.
You know, electrify our school buses and our transit systems. And we're going to build national charging networks for electric vehicles; eliminate the nation's lead service pipes. We got 400,000 home- --
I mean, there's just a whole lot we can do that's going to put a lot of people to work. And it's going to improve the life of a lot of people.
We're going to update our power grid -- which, as you saw what happened to Texas last year, there's a lot we can do. It's going to generate -- and, Lonnie, your (inaudible) is going be awful busy, and --
MR. STEPHENSON: We're ready.
THE PRESIDENT: And we're going -- we have to win the comp- -- we really do. This is not hyperbole. We have to win the competition for the 21st century. That's really what's at stake, and I think you all know that. And that's what the Bipartisan Infrastructure does, in my view.
I want to thank everyone here for supporting it. We're going to get into the details, among all of us, about what we think about what needs to be improved, what can be made better or worse. You know, so, we want everybody to be engaged.
So, thank you all, folks, for being here. We're going to now get down to business.
Q: Mr. President, what conversations have you had with public health officials about possibly changing the mask mandate for vaccinated Americans?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, I'll respond to the COVID question quickly.
We follow the science. What's happening now is all the major scientific operations in this country and the 25-person group we put together are looking at all the possibilities of what's happening now.
We have a pandemic among the nonvaccinated -- those who are not vaccinated.
If you are vaccinated, you are safe. If you are vaccinated, you have over a 98 percent chance of never catching the virus at all. And if you catch it, you're likely to -- overwhelming proof, so far, is you're not going to be hospitalized, you're not going to be sick, you're going to probably have no signs that you had it, and you are not going to die. It's a simple proposition.
And what they're doing is they're going into -- investigating every aspect of any change that could or might take place.
But the vaccines are good against all of the variants that are out there, including the Delta variant.
Thank you so much for being here.

Remarks on Signing the VOCA Fix to Sustain the Crime Victims Fund Act of 2021
","
(""Hail to the Chief"" is played.)
THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Every time I hear that, I wonder when he's coming. (Laughter.) Please, everybody sit down. Thank you.
Let me begin by doing something no speaker should ever do -- by apologizing. I got a little tied up in that other office I work in, Pat, and I apologize for keeping you waiting because I know you're all as equally busy as I am. And I want to thank you.
Today, I think is a day of hope. And I mean that. A day of hope and healing for victims or crime and organizations that support those victims of crime.
And I want to thank the Vice President and the Second Gentleman, Senators Durbin -- I think he's here; I thought I saw him. Senators Durbin and Baldwin and Grassley and Graham and Murkowski. Representatives Nadler and Fitzpatrick and Jackson-Lee and Wagner and Scanlon. And everyone who has helped make possible this moment, including so many of you who are here today that I haven't mentioned.
When someone commits a crime, it's -- it's not enough to bring the predator to justice; we also need to support the victims. And it's something that, way back -- 150 years ago, when I was Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, we spent a lot of time working on and setting up victims' funds. That's what this Crime Victims Fund does.
In many years of working on the issue, I've visited an awful lot of domestic violence shelters. Every time I'd go into a city, I would quietly -- before I went to where I was supposed to be -- quietly slip in and spend time in a domestic violence shelter to speak to the people giving the services of people getting the services.
And, you know, many times, the body language that you'd see when you walked in was one of the victims of crime finding themselves almost curled up, Dianne, in a ball. They were still suffering from a serious, serious -- not only physical abuse they received, but, quite frankly, the emotional abuse. And you can see the pain. You can see the pain was still with them, and you wondered when was this going to abate, no matter what we did.
According to the CDC -- and I'm -- I think Senator Feinstein remembers -- I got in trouble because when I was pushing the legislation, way back in those days, I said, ""I'm convinced that women who are victims of domestic violence suffer from post-traumatic stress no different than a solider being shot at regularly."" You come home and every time your significant other would come home, if dinner wasn't ready, they smashed your head against the wall. There's no -- there's no difference than being shot at.
And the CDFE [sic] -- the CDC, two years later, came out and said, ""Survivors can experience mental health problems and such depression and the symptoms of post-traumatic stress syndrome."" Even before research confirmed it, you could see it.
And there are economic costs for survivors as well --medical costs, lost productivity from work, and navigating the court system. That's why Victims Compensation Program helps victims and their families cover the costs they'd suffered from the crime. They can -- there can be counseling and medical bills; lost wages because you couldn't work; paying for temporary housing for a family fleeing abuse; even fixing a broken door kicked down by an abuser. And, you know, the vast majority of children out in the street are the children who are, in fact, the children of abused women. It can also be a long-term support survivors need to heal, every time, in every single sense of the word.
In 2019, these victim compensation funds went directly to over 230,000 victims -- 230,000. These funds also got to states, territories, and Tribes to support thousands of victim services organizations. These organizations have provided services and support to over 13 million survivors.
And, by the way, last night, some of you heard me talk about the need for more policing that understands the need for communities and citizens. These funds will also go to law enforcement agencies to support training on how to respond to victims who have experienced trauma.
In 1984, I was proud to support the -- the passage of the Victims of Crime Act, and created -- that created this fund. I'm also proud to sign the law that significantly strengthened it today. This fund doesn't take a dime of taxpayers' money; it uses fines and penalties paid by convicted federal criminals. However, fines from what are called ""non-prosecutorial agreements"" or defendant -- or ""deferred prosecution agreements"" did not go into this Victims Crimes Fund in the past.
Since there's been more and more of these agreements in recent years, the fund is being depleted. That meant dramatic cuts in the funding it could provide for victims and for organizations to support these victims.
Between 2017 and today, the amount of money in these funds has gone down 92 percent, which has resulted in a 70 percent reduction in victims assistance programs and grants. This means that, for a lot of victims, the help they need isn't there any longer.
When my son Beau was the Attorney General of the state of Delaware, he took pride in getting more support more quickly to victims, especially to protect and care for child victims.
And I know that, as the San Francisco DA and the California Attorney General, Vice President Harris expanded support for victims of crime and launched one of the nation's first medical centers focused on treating childhood trauma caused by violence in a home or in a community.
This bill is going to allow us to make -- make sure that all the fines and penalties that are from federal cases go into the victims -- the Crime Victims Fund to rebuild this fund, because it's badly needed.
This is going to enable us to provide more help and support to victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, child abuse, trafficking, and other crimes all across America.
In order to provide more access and safety and services for victims of gender-based violence, it's long past time to re- -- reauthorize and strengthen the protections through the Violence Against Women Act. Please. Please. You know, you can -- (applause).
You know from experience you all can come together in a bipartisan, bicameral way and to pass this bill. We need to do the same thing to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act without further delay.
You know, after these changes in the Victims Crime Act passed this week, a leader from one of the state's -- state's Coalition Against Domestic Violence sent a letter to her national organization. And she wrote about working in the shelter where their ability to serve people rose and fell based on the fundings of victim services. She told the story of a client she lost to domestic violence homicide because the budget cuts left them without space at the shelter or staff needed to help this particular woman.
Upon learning about the law I'm about to sign today, she wrote, and I quote -- I quote, ""I think about her every day. This is going to be truly lifesaving,"" end of quote. This is what you've done -- truly lifesaving.
In closing, I want to thank those angels working on the frontlines to help these victims, especially during this pandemic that's made the work both more difficult, more in demand, and more dangerous. And I want to thank the advocates who mobilized and bring together these important changes in the law.
There are thousands of people out there who may not know about the work you did to get this bill passed, but they'll know that they are getting the help they need to put their lives back together and move toward healing and toward justice. I will now have the great honor of signing the bill. And I'd invite the sponsors to come on up and stand with me if you're willing. (Applause.)
(The act is signed.)
This is one of those deals where what they did is literally, not figuratively, going to change the lives of women and children and some men out there. So, thank you. (Applause.)

Remarks in an Exchange with Reporters Prior to Departure from Cincinnati Airport in Hebron, Kentucky
","
THE PRESIDENT: I can't see you, but I know you're there. Thank you for your patience today. I know it's a long day for you. I really mean it. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
I was just talking to one of the people who asked the question (inaudible).
Q: Mr. President, the debt limit: Mitch McConnell said today that Republicans won't vote to raise the debt limit, and Democrats will have to include it in reconciliation. What's your response?
THE PRESIDENT: I was hoping that wouldn't be the case. You know, for the last four years, they've just extended the debt limit. The reason for the significant debt is because of their -- their debt, their tax limit -- excuse me, their tax cut.
And there are going to be a couple of very difficult decisions that are going to have to be made to get through the end of the year. And one of them is the debt limit and extending the debt.
So, I don't have an answer for you, but it's -- I hope we can get by it.
Q: Mr. President, what do you think of the Republicans and Fox News changing their tune on the vaccine?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, rather than be critical of it, I thank them for it. I think it's a matter of -- first of all, in truth, I don't know how many of them believed what they were saying. They may have really believed it -- the things that they've been saying.
And -- but I think once the realization occurred that this virus is only killing primarily those people who had not been vaccinated, I think it was sort of, as we Catholics say, a bit of an ""epiphany"" for them. You know, it was a -- like a -- you know, conversion on the way to Damascus or something.
But I think it became real, and I -- I'm glad they had the courage to say what they said. And hopefully it will have some impact.
Q: Any comment on the Nord Stream deal, sir? The fact that there's a deal that Nord Stream 2 is going to move forward.
THE PRESIDENT: Yes, I can. Nord Stream is 99 percent finished. The idea that anything that was going to be said or done was going to stop it was not possible.
But I had, as you know, very, very fruitful discussions with Angela Merkel, and her -- she is working with the German government on a commitment that suggests that if, in fact, Russia takes pains to deliberately inflict pain on Ukraine or other countries, they will respond.
Q: Mr. President, what do you say to Americans who have done everything right? They've gotten fully vaccinated and they still contract COVID -- a ""breakthrough case,"" as it's called. What do say to them?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, I say to them: There are very, very, very, very, very, very few people -- number one. Those that it happened to, I don't -- it may be possible -- I know of none where they're hospitalized, in ICU, and/or passed away.
So, at a minimum, I can say that even if they did contract it -- which I'm sorry they did -- it's such a tiny percentage, and it is not life-threatening.
Guys, we got to get on the plane or they're going to leave us all. Thank you.
Q: Mr. President, one more question on January 6th.
THE PRESIDENT: January 6th is -- look, guys.
Q: Are you concerned that no matter what happens now, the result is going to be perceived as partisan?
THE PRESIDENT: No, because I think the American public, as I said tonight -- you can't not understand what happened and still be partisan and try to cover it up. But nobody really believes it wasn't an insurrection. I mean, you know it. You can see it on the looks on their faces. They know it.
Thank you.

Remarks in a CNN Town Hall with Don Lemon at Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati, Ohio
","
THE PRESIDENT: How you doing, pal? Good to see you.
MR. LEMON: Good to see you.
THE PRESIDENT: Good to see you.
MR. LEMON: How you been?
THE PRESIDENT: Well. (Applause.) Thank you. (Laughter.)
MR. LEMON: It's good to see you.
THE PRESIDENT: It's good to be back.
MR. LEMON: Yeah, you as well.
So, listen, I'm going to get to the audience. And I know you don't want to sit down, right?
THE PRESIDENT: No.
MR. LEMON: You'd rather stand here and talk to these guys.
THE PRESIDENT: I'm going to go out in the audience. (Laughs.)
MR. LEMON: We're going to get to the audience questions in just a moment. But I have a couple questions I want to ask you.
THE PRESIDENT: Sure.
MR. LEMON: Because you know the pandemic is a big concern for everyone, really, around the world --
THE PRESIDENT: Sure is.
MR. LEMON: -- especially around America. New cases are up three -- you know, three times since last month. Right? The pandemic is a big concern. Hospitalizations, death rising.
So, you said last month that this -- that the virus is in retreat. Do you still feel that way? Is that still the case?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, the virus -- look, here's the -- it's real simple: We have a pandemic for those who haven't gotten a vaccination. It's that basic, that simple. Ten thousand people have recently died; 9,950 of them, thereabouts, are people who hadn't been vaccinated.
There's a simple, basic proposition: If you're vaccinated, you're not going to be hospitalized, you're not going to be in an ICU unit, and you're not going to die.
So it's gigantically important that you act like -- we all act like Americans that care about our -- our fellow Americans. To get -- there's legitimate questions people can ask -- that they worry about getting vaccinated -- but the questions should be asked, answered, and people should get vaccinated.
But this is not a pandemic. We've made sure that since I got in office, we -- we've inoculated over 160 million people; 85 percent of people over the age of 50. (Applause.) Anyway.
It's frustrating.
MR. LEMON: But what do you say to people who are worried about a new round of restrictions and mask mandates and so forth?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, I'm saying -- look -- (laughs) -- it's a little bit like when I got elected. You know, the -- this pandemic was out of control. You know, we've lost more people in the United States -- over 630-some-thousand people than in every major war we've ever fought, in the United States of America. And that's come to a screeching halt for those who've been vaccinated. It really has. Not a joke. This is overwhelming evidence to sustain that.
And so, what I say to people who are worried about a new pandemic is: Get vaccinated. If you're vaccinated, even if you do catch the ""virus,"" quote, unquote -- like people talk about it in normal terms -- you're in overwhelm- -- not many people do. If you do, you're not likely to get sick. You're probably going to be symptomless. You're not going to be in a position where you -- where your life is in danger.
So, it's really, kind of, basic.
Q: Well, let's get to the questions, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT: Okay.
Q: Okay. I want to introduce you to Andrea Granieri. She's a community resource director for a charter school. She's a Democrat currently running for her local school board.
Andrea, welcome.
THE PRESIDENT: God love you. The most important, thankless job in the world: being on a school board.
Q: Thank you. So, here in Hamilton County, the vaccination rate remains at about 50 percent -- and you talked about the virus that's spreading. Masks are seen less and less. And, as you know, children under age 12 still are not eligible to be vaccinated. Schools are working with all of this information as they think about reopening next month. As a school employee and as a parent to children under age 12, what -- I'm really concerned. What is your message to those parents, educators, and school districts?
THE PRESIDENT: I understand your concern. I really do. My children are grown now, but my grandchildren -- and I have one who's only one-and-a-half years old. So, you know, I understand -- number one.
My message is that one of the reasons why -- you remember the criticism I got initially, saying, ""Teachers should get vaccination, get in line first."" The vast majority of teachers are vaccinated, number one.
Number two, the CDC is going to say that what we should do is, everyone over the age of -- under the age of 12 should probably be wearing a mask in school. That's probably what's going to happen.
Secondly, those over the age of 12 who are able to get vaccinated -- if you're vaccinated, you shouldn't wear a mask. If you aren't vaccinated, you should be wearing a mask.
So it's going to get a little bit tight in terms of, ""Well, are mom or dad being honest that, you know, Johnny did or did not get vaccinated?"" That's going to raise questions. But I think what's going to happen is you're going to see this work out in ways that people are going to know in the community. Everybody knows in the community whether or not Johnny really did get the vaccination when he's 15 or 17 years old.
And so it's going to -- I think it's -- it's a matter of community responsibility, and I think you're going to see it work through.
MR. LEMON: Well, let me ask -- let me follow up on her question, asking: When will children under 12 be able to get vaccinated?
THE PRESIDENT: Soon, I believe. Now, look, one of the things that I committed to do when I got elected -- I said --
MR. LEMON: How soon is ""soon,"" Mr. President? Not to --
THE PRESIDENT: Well, I -- and let me he- -- let me finish the question -- the answer. ""Soon"" in the sense that I do not tell any scientists what they should do. I do not interfere. (Applause.)
And so they are doing -- they are doing the examinations now -- the testing now, and making the decision now. When they are ready, when they've done all the scientific need to be done to determine children at ages 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, they, in fact, are -- all have different makeups. They're developing. They're trying to figure out whether or not there's a vaccination that would affect one child that's at such and such an age and not another child. That's underway.
Just like the other question, there's a logical -- and I've heard you speak about it because you always -- I'm not being solicitous, but you -- you're always straight up about what you're doing.
And the question is whether or not we should be in a position where you are -- why can't the -- the -- the experts say, ""We know that this virus is, in fact -- it's going to be…"" -- or, excuse me -- ""We know why all the drugs approved are not temporarily approved, but permanently approved."" That's underway too. I expect that to occur quickly.
MR. LEMON: Well, that means -- you mean for the FDA?
THE PRESIDENT: For the FDA.
MR. LEMON: Yeah. So, what do you --
THE PRESIDENT: The Federal Drug Administration.
MR. LEMON: You said that you're talking to scientists, though, but what -- what are they telling you, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT: What they're telling me is, ""Let us decide, based on scientific data, in how we proceed. Do it the way we would ordinarily do it.""
Look, for example, everybody talks about how, you know, this virus came -- this -- this -- the drugs that are designed to kill the virus came along so quickly. They've been working on it for two decades. There's nothing quick about this. It's been over two decades.
So people said, ""I'm not taking a drug that was approved so quickly."" It's been two decades. The truth is we haven't said it enough to people to allay their feals [sic]. There's nothing -- their fears. This is nothing that just happened yesterday and they said, ""Well, let's take a shot on this."" And there's a process. Usually the process takes the better part of a year or more to get some of these things decided.
But the expectation -- they're not promising me any specific date -- but my expectation, talking to the group of scientists we put together -- over 20 of them, plus others in the field -- is that sometime maybe in the beginning of the school year -- at the end of August, beginning of September, October -- they'll get a final approval saying the FDA said, ""No, this is it. It's good.""
But again, one last thing. I -- we don't talk enough to you about this, I don't think. One last thing that's really important is: We're not in a position where we think that any virus -- including the Delta virus, which is much more transmissible and more deadly in terms of non -- unvaccinated people -- the vi- -- the various shots that people are getting now cover that. They're -- you're okay. You're not going to -- you're not going to get COVID if you have these vaccinations.
MR. LEMON: Yeah. I want to stay on the subject. I want to get to Dr. Nicole Baldwin. She's a pediatrician and a Republican.
Dr. Baldwin, go ahead.
THE PRESIDENT: Doc, how are you?
Q: Hi. Thank you for taking my question, Mr. President. I am a pediatrician who utilizes social media to educate about health. And I'm very concerned about the rise in misinformation from the anti-vaccine community that is eroding trust in lifesaving vaccines. Spread of this misinformation and declining vaccination rates could leave Americans vulnerable to vaccine-preventable diseases in the future.
So, what I want to know is: What is the White House doing to combat medical misinformation and to restore America's faith in science?
THE PRESIDENT: What we're doing is, number one, to restore America's faith in science is listen to the scientists. (Applause begins.) No, I'm not joking. (Applause.) I mean, literally listen to the scientists, and not interfere, not rush anything. Just make -- let the scientists proceed, because they desperately want to get this right -- number one.
Number two, you may have heard -- I never get myself in trouble, as you know, politically -- (laughs) -- but you may have heard that I was critical of some of the things that are on Facebook, and it was that I was attacking Facebook. I wasn't attacking Facebook. There was a report out saying that for that -- something like 45 percent of the overwhelming disinformation on Facebook comes from 12 individuals. I said: They're killing people -- those 12 individuals; that misinformation is going to kill people. Not a joke. Not a joke.
It's like telling your kid, ""I tell you what…"" -- four years old -- ""…when you see a red light, cross the street."" I mean, come on.
And so, what we're trying to do is use every avenue we can -- public, private, government, non-government -- to try to get the facts out, what they really are. And one of the things, Doc, that's happening, that I'm feeling better about -- I'm not being a wise guy now. You know, you -- one of those other networks is not a big fan of mine. (Laughter.) One you talk about a lot.
But if you noticed, as they say in that southern part of my state, ""They've had an altar call,"" some of those guys. (Laughter.) All of a sudden, they're out there saying, ""Let's get vaccinated. Let's get vaccinated."" The very people who before this were saying --
So that -- but that -- I shouldn't make fun. That's good. It's good. It's good. We just have to keep telling the truth. That's why -- for example, my wife just flew to Alaska today to do an event in Alaska about making sure people understand and get vaccinated, talking about COVID, et cetera.
So it's -- you know. And, by the way, there's pockets. If you notice, there's about -- what? -- four or five states that have close to 45 percent or whatever. Don't hold me to the exact number.
MR. LEMON: Lower than that, even. In my home state of Louisiana, it's 36 percent, and I think there are other southern states.
THE PRESIDENT: No, but I mean, out of all the cases --
MR. LEMON: Yeah.
THE PRESIDENT: -- all the cases, a very overwhelming majority of those cases are in four or five states. And it's just not -- there's nothing political about this. There's no blue or red. (Applause.)
MR. LEMON: Well, let's bring in Christian Oliver. He's a Democrat. He works for the insurance industry.
Christian, what's your question?
Q: Well, so, my wife Stephanie and I are newlyweds, as of this past Saturday.
THE PRESIDENT: I'd brag if I were you too. (Applause.)
As they say when they look at me and my wife: ""You married up, kid."" (Laughter.)
Q: (Laughs.) Thank you.
We require all of our guests and vendors to be vaccinated to ensure safety. We are African American, and in many of our communities, people are against the vaccine. A reason that stood out the most in regards to our guests is that they don't see the vaccine as being as safe as the CDC put it -- puts it out to be. How are you working toward convincing those in these communities that the vaccine is safe?
THE PRESIDENT: It's really an important question because, in the African American community, there is less of an uptake of the vaccination. Number one, there's a reason for that: You know, you go back just to even World War Two. African Americans were used as experimental; they were almost like guinea pigs in terms of ex- -- they were -- anyway.
And your mom and dad remember that, or your grandparents remember that. And so there's a reason for people to think that, ""I don't know, I'm not sure I trust. I'm not sure I trust this."" Plus, a lot of disinformation on top of it.
One of the things that we're doing is what I've done -- ""we've"" done, excuse me -- my team has done -- is we've provided the ability to put in African American communities the vaccine and those who are, in fact, able to administer the vaccine, and people who are respected in the community, in the vacc- -- in those areas, particularly in areas where you have public health commu- -- public health centers, where you, in fact, have people who are the folks who are really at the low end of the economic scale, don't have much access to anything.
So we've taken literally mobile vans and people to the communities, to the hardest-hit communities, and it's beginning to have some impact. But we have to talk about it more.
For example, I was just with -- I get in trouble because my wife is a Philly girl and a Philly fan, an Eagles fan. I just hosted the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. And -- and there's a guy -- there's a quarterback there. What's his name, man? (Laughter.)
Anyway, all kidding aside, you know, what we're doing is getting people of consequence, who are respected in the community -- whether they're athletes, whether or not they are entertainers, whether they're just well respected. And, by the way, one of the things I've gotten able to get done: I've get -- I have overwhelming support from the African American clergy that I sort of come from, and my so- -- support. They are opening up their churches for -- as vaccination centers. (Applause.)
MR. LEMON: Can I ask you something, Mr. President? Because, you know -- and, by the way, you got -- I don't know if you heard that you got applause when you corrected the ""I"" for ""we."" And we're talking about ""we,"" and I think that's --
THE PRESIDENT: Well, it is ""we.""
MR. LEMON: -- a commendable attribute to have.
But even with my own family -- I was just able to get with them. I haven't seen my mom in a year and a half, except for two weeks ago. I hadn't seen my family for two years since the last time they visited me two summers ago. But even within my own family -- here I am on television every night -- there is ambivalence, there's misinformation, and there's also mistrust in the system. How do you fix that?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think -- you're going to -- this is going to seem like a non-answer to start with. One of the things I said when I ran for office -- it's not Democrat or Republican again -- is we got to restore faith in government. You got to get people to a point where they trust government.
And I made a commitment that when I made a mistake, I'd tell you I've made mistakes. And when I think I got it right, I'll say it. But I'll take responsibility for what I do and say.
Part of it is just generally -- (applause) -- no, I don't mean that -- part of it is, generally, raising confidence in elected officials. Raising confidence. And I know this is going to sound like a non-answer to you, but part of this is that, you know -- you know because you're one of the most informed journalists in the country. You know the criticism I got when I said I'm going to unite the country. They said, ""You can't unite the country."" Well, if we can't unite the country, we can never get some of these problems solved.
And that goes to trust. Why can't you unite the country? Why isn't there a willingness to trust? Government trust is really at a -- was at an incredibly low ebb. It's coming up some.
So with regard to your family in particular. Part of it is not just that they see you on television and trust you; the people who seem to have the most impact are the -- are, you know, that -- for that 17-year-old kid, the kid that he or she plays ball with. ""You got the vaccination? Are you okay? I mean, you seem…"" ""No, it works."" Or you, you know -- or the mom and dad, or the neighbor, or when you go to church, or when you're -- no, I really mean it.
There are trusted interlocutors. Think of the people -- if your kid wanted to find out whether or not there were -- there's a man on the moon, or whatever -- you know, something, or, you know, whether those aliens are here or not -- you know, who are the people they talk to beyond the kids who love talking about it? They go to people they respect, and they say, ""What do you think?""
And so they should be asking other people -- the people there -- everything from their teachers to their ministers to the priest, to people that they trust.
MR. LEMON: Well, part of it is that -- don't you think part of it is that young people, especially those who are 30 -- maybe 30, 40 and under, they feel like they're invincible; they haven't faced mortality.
THE PRESIDENT: Isn't it amazing we're saying ""40 or younger""? (Laughter.) It's hard to say, isn't it?
MR. LEMON: It is. But for them, you know, at first, the va- -- at first, the virus wasn't affecting them as much.
THE PRESIDENT: Yes.
MR. LEMON: And so they may feel that they're invincible. And now that this Delta variant is affecting them, maybe they'll have a ""come to Jesus"" of some sort. I'm --
THE PRESIDENT: Well, by the way, I think that is -- that's happening. And, look, think about this: This is the worst health crisis in 100 years. As I said, more people have died than all our major wars combined. Think about that.
If I told you that or you had told me that two years ago, I'd say, ""Come on. That's not going to happen in America."" But it happened. It happened. And people are unfortunately -- some more slowly than others --
Now, by the way, remember when I first got elected, the issue was, well, I said I was going to do a million shots a week, and people said, ""Biden can't do that"" or ""Biden team can't do that."" And it was 2 million. We had trouble getting enough people -- and people who wanted to get vaccinated. We're opening up stadiums. We're getting 100,000 people coming through.
So, the vast majority of the American people said, ""I understand. I want to get this vaccination."" But now, when the -- when it's phased off, either ""I'm invincible, I'm young, I'm not going to get sick, it won't happen to me"" -- or whatever the reason -- now they're looking around and they're saying, ""Whoa, boy. In the community I live in, there's very few people who have gotten the vaccination. This COVID is much more transmissible; it's really rising. I better get some…""
So, I think it's gradually changing. And you got a great dog there, kid. (Laughter.)
Q: (Inaudible.) (Off-mic.)
MR. LEMON: By the way, that is Danielle Lippi. She's a student here at the university, and she's a Republican. She's got a question for you. Go ahead, Danielle.
Q: Yes. Okay.
THE PRESIDENT: But your dog is a Democrat -- I can tell. (Laughter and applause.) I'm teasing. I'm teasing. I'm a big dog person. I'm sorry.
Q: Her name is Wonder. (Laughs.)
So, my question is: The economy is picking up significantly as it reopens from the pandemic. Are you concerned about the higher inflation prices, especially as we see gasoline, automotive, and food prices increase rapidly? What is your administration doing to help prevent the economy from overheating, such as the poor and middle class are not hurt by the higher prices of goods in the long run?
THE PRESIDENT: First of all, the good news is the economy is picking up significantly. It's rational, when you think about it. The cost of an automobile bill, it's kind of back to what it was before the pandemic. We compare what the prices were for the last year in the pandemic, and they are up. They're up because, in fact, there was not much to call for.
For example, automobiles: You know, you had the rental car companies selling off their entire stock. You found yourself in the same way with automobile dealers. And all of a sudden, now it's coming back, and we're going to grow at 7 percent -- is expected. We created more jobs in the first six months of my -- our administration than any time in American history. No President has ever -- no administration has ever created as many jobs. And all of a sudden, people are saying -- (applause) -- no, I don't say it -- but it goes to the legitimate question being asked about the concern about inflation.
The vast majority of the experts, including Wall Street, are suggesting that it's highly unlikely that it's going to be long-term inflation that's going to get out of hand. There will be near-term inflation because everything is now trying to be picked back up.
And, by the way, that's one of the reasons why I also signed an executive order dealing with the whole idea of competition -- you know, the idea that we're in a situation where there are so many companies who are keeping people out of the competition. For example, you have over 600,000 people out there signing -- 6 million people signing a -- I better check the number -- of -- signing non-compete agreements. Not because they have any sta- -- any secret, but because they were working for one fast food restaurant, and they're told they can't get 10 cents more going across town going to the other fast food restaurant. Why? To keep wages down.
And so what's happening now is, all of a sudden, people are having choices. You know, I always thought the free market system was not only that there's competition among companies, but, guess what? Companies should have to compete for workers. Guess what? Maybe even pay more money. (Applause.)
MR. LEMON: So, you seem pretty confident that inflation is temporary. But if you're pumping all of this money into the economy, couldn't that add to --
THE PRESIDENT: No, look, here's the deal: Moody's, today, went out -- a Wall Street firm, not some liberal think tank -- said if we passed the other two things I'm trying to get done, we will, in fact, reduce inflation. Reduce inflation. Reduce inflation -- because we're going to be providing good opportunities and jobs for people who, in fact, are going to be reinvesting that money back into all the things we're talking about, driving down prices, not raising prices.
And so, it is -- I sincerely mean this: Prices are up now, and they're up in -- for example, you're in a position where you're trying to build a house, trying to find two-by-fours and lumber. Well, guess what? People stopped working cutting lumber. They stopped doing it because they -- the unemployment was so down. Now, all of a sudden, there's this need because people are coming back. And guess what? Instead of paying 10 cents, you're paying 20. But you understand what I'm saying.
MR. LEMON: Yeah.
THE PRESIDENT: It relates to what, in fact, is now needed because we're growing. I don't know anybody, including Larry Summers -- who's a friend of mine -- who's worried about inflation, is suggesting that there's any long-term march here if we do the things we're going to do.
For example, if we get this build on that I've been -- put together a long time ago -- and, by the way, I want to say, I'm in his territory. You know, there's -- Portman is a good man. Portman is a congressman from this area. I talked to him before I got -- and I really mean it. He's a decent, honorable man, and he and I are working on trying to get this -- this infrastructure bill passed.
MR. LEMON: But you're -- you're talking about Senator Rob Portman of Ohio?
THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, I'm sorry. I --
MR. LEMON: No, but --
THE PRESIDENT: I thought that (inaudible). I apologize.
MR. LEMON: Yeah, but -- no, since you -- you mention that infrastructure, the bipartisan infrastructure deal failed the procedural vote today. Right?
THE PRESIDENT: But -- no --
MR. LEMON: In the Senate today.
THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, it did. But that's irrelevant.
MR. LEMON: Go on. Okay.
In the Senate, negotiators say that they need more time.
THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
MR. LEMON: Okay. So, then -- but they're expected to vote again on Monday, but how much time do you think that they need to get this done?
THE PRESIDENT: Until Monday. (Laughter.) Look -- no, I'm not being facetious. I'm not being facetious. You had up to 20 Republicans sign a letter saying, ""We think we need this deal. We think we need this deal."" And so I think there'll be -- by the way, the reason we're talking this way: We need 60 votes to get something moving. And what's going to happen is, I believe -- because I take my Republican colleagues at my -- at their word when you shake. I come from a tradition in the Senate: You shake your hand. That's it. You keep your word.
And I found Rob Portman does that. I found that -- you know, your governor is a good man. You shake his hand, it's done. (Applause.) No, I really mean that. I'm not -- I'm not being falsely complimentary.
MR. LEMON: Do you think it's going to move forward in the Senate on Monday?
THE PRESIDENT: I do. Here's what I think: What happens is, the vote on Monday is a motion to be able to proceed to this issue. Then they're going to debate the issue of the elements -- the individual elements of this plan to sake [sic] sure we're going to fix that damn bridge of yours going into Kentucky. (Applause.) No, I'm serious.
MR. LEMON: We're going to talk about that bridge in just a moment. We asked (inaudible) about that bridge.
THE PRESIDENT: Anyway. But I think it's going to get done.
You may find in the amendments that take place on the detail -- the detail of whether or not -- and I'm the guy that wrote this bill to begin with, and so I've had to compromise to make changes in the bill. When I say ""I,"" I campaigned on this. I mean, everybody thought I was a little nuts when I talked about there are three reasons why I was running: one, to restore the soul of this country and bring back some decency; two, to build back the middle class because they've been getting really knocked around a long time. They're the backbone that unite the country.
And one of the big issues was dealing with infrastructure. Remember, the last four years we had ""Infrastructure Week"" every week. We didn't do a thing. But it's necessary. (Laughter.) No, I really mean it. It's going to not only increase job opportunities, it's going to increase commerce. It's going to -- it's a good thing, and I think we're going to get it done.
MR. LEMON: A lot of this stuff you're going need -- you need bipartisan support. So, let's -- let's talk about that.
Our next question comes from Cindy Peebles. She's a financial executive and a Democrat. Go ahead, Cindy.
Q: Hello, Mr. President. I am dismayed at how often Democratic plans for stabilizing the economy or shoring up new strains of the virus are held hostage by the utopian need to gain bipartisan support. It appears, at every turn, the Democratic plan is weakened and still secures zero Republican votes. Sometimes the opposition is just wrong, and working to get them to agree with you is fruitless. Why is the strategy to abandon the need for bipartisanship not the right answer?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, look, I may be the wrong guy to talk to because I spent a lot of time as a Senator and Vice President, and I'm going to say something outrageous: I don't know you'll find any Republican I've ever worked with who says I ever broke my word, didn't do exactly what I said I would do and keep my word.
And I was able to get an awful lot of compromises put together to do really good things, to change things. And I still believe that's possible.
But the well has been so poisoned over the last four years. And even now, there's still this lingering effort. A lot of my Republican friends -- and I'm not talking about Portman; I'm not talking about your governor -- a lot of my Republican friends say, ""Joe, I -- I know you're right, but if I do this, I'll get primaried and I'll lose my primary. I'll be in trouble.""
But I think that's all beginning to move. I don't mean overnight. Don't get me wrong, I'm not playing out some panacea here. But I think people are figuring out that if we want to -- I've always found you get rewarded for doing what you think at the time is the right thing, and people really believe you believe it's the right thing to do.
MR. LEMON: Yeah.
THE PRESIDENT: And so I think you're seeing it coming together. And, by the way, the compromises are -- you know, are real -- compromise within my own party between the far left and the center and some of the folks who are more conservative. That's coming together. They said that would never happen, but if you notice, it has happened.
MR. LEMON: Well, let's talk a little bit more about bipartisanship. You know, the Republicans removed all their picks today for the January 6 committee -- the select committee. Nancy Pelosi rejected two of them.
The first thing I want to ask you is, what's your reaction to that? But number two, if Republicans and Democrats can't come together -- right? -- to investigate the biggest attack on our Capitol in 200 years, what makes you think that they can come together on anything?
THE PRESIDENT: These people. (Applause.) No, I mean it. I'm not being facetious. Democrats and Republicans. I don't care if you think I'm Satan reincarnated. (Laughter.) The fact is, you can't look at that television and say, ""Nothing happened on the 6th."" You can't listen to people who say this was a ""peaceful march."" No, I'm serious. Think about it. Think of the things being said.
I've been through the other end of this when the Democrats, 35 years ago, were way off to the other side. Think about it.
MR. LEMON: But what you can do, though -- what they can do is try to change the narrative and say, ""Well, why wasn't Nancy Pelosi prepared? Why weren't the Democrats prepared for that to happen?""
THE PRESIDENT: Well, no, they can say that, and you can make honest judgments about it. I have --
Look, I sometimes get myself in trouble for what I'm about to say -- (laughter) -- not that I ever get in trouble. (Laughs.) As you've heard me say before: No one ever doubts I mean what I say; the problem is I sometimes say all that I mean. And -- (laughter).
But all kidding aside, I have faith in the American people -- I really do -- to ultimately get to the right place.
And, by the way, many times Republicans are in the right place. I don't mean that the Repub- -- that it's always the Democratic point of view.
But some of the stuff -- I mean, QAnon: The idea that the Democrats or that Biden is hiding people and sucking the blood of children and -- no, I'm serious. That's --
Now, you may not like me, and that's your right. Look, it's a simple thing. You can walk out and say, ""I just don't like the way that guy wears his tie. I'm voting against him."" You have a right to do that. You have a right to do that.
But the kinds of things that are being said of late, I think you're beginning to see some of the -- and both -- and by Democrats as well -- sort of the venom get -- sort of -- sort of leak out a lot of it. We got to get beyond this.
What do you say to your grandchildren or you children about what's happening? Do you ever remember a time like this before, in the entire history, whether you're Democrat or Republican?
This is not who we are. And I'll say one last thing -- and you're going to -- I've had a lot of experience internationally. And I mean that -- not good or bad, just I have; I've chaired the Foreign Relations Committee. I've been deeply involved. I did national security for the -- our last -- the -- the -- the administration with Barack.
But, folks, the rest of the world is wondering about us. Those of you who travel abroad -- not a joke, not a joke -- you ask -- you know, when I went to this G7, all the major democracies -- I walked in -- and I know a lot of them because of my role in the past. And they walk in and I said, ""America is back."" And they go -- I'm serious, heads of state -- I give you my word as a Biden -- said, ""Are you really back? I mean, how can I -- we believe you, Joe, but will the country ever get it together?""
I talked to Xi -- Xi Jinping in China, who I know well. We don't agree on a lot of things. He's a bright and really tough guy. He truly believes that the 21st century will be determined by oligarchs, by -- and I'm not -- not a joke.
Democracies cannot function in the 21st century -- the argument is -- because things are moving so rapidly -- so, so rapidly that you can't pull together a nation that is divided to get a consensus on acting quickly.
So, autocrats -- autocracies -- I had a long meeting with Putin, and I continued -- I know him well. These guys actually are betting -- betting -- I'm not joking -- on autocracies.
Democracy has to stand up and demonstrate it can get something done. It's not just important that we are -- (applause) -- no, I really mean it.
MR. LEMON: Mr. President, we're just getting started. We got a lot to talk about.
THE PRESIDENT: I'm sorry.
MR. LEMON: No, no, no. You're good. We're going to take a quick break, and we're going to come back with more questions for the President of the United States right after this. (Applause.)
(Commercial break begins.)
(Commercial break ends.)
MR. LEMON: Welcome back, everyone. We are live at a CNN Town Hall in Cincinnati, Ohio, with the President of the United States.
Straight to the audience for a question. This is John Lanni. He is the owner and co-founder of a restaurant group with 39 restaurants across the country, Mr. President. He is a Republican.
John.
Q: Hi there, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT: Hey, John.
Q: Hi. Thank you for taking my question tonight. We employ hundreds of hard-working team members throughout the state of Ohio and across the country. And we're looking to hire more every day as we try to restart our restaurant business.
The entire industry, amongst other industries, continue to struggle to find employees. How do you and the Biden administration plan to incentivize those that haven't returned to work yet? Hiring is our top priority right now.
THE PRESIDENT: Well, two things. One, if you notice, we kept you open. We spent billions of dollars to make sure restaurants could stay open. And -- and a lot of people who now -- who work as waiters and waitresses decided that they don't want to do that anymore because there's other opportunities and higher wages, because there's a lot of openings now in jobs. And people are beginning to move -- beginning to move.
There's some evidence that maintaining the ability to continue not -- to not have your -- have to pay your rent so you don't get thrown out, and being able to provide for unemployment insurance, has kept people from going back to work. There's no -- not much distinction between not going back to work in a restaurant and not going back to work at a -- at a factory.
So people are looking to change opportunities, change what they're doing.
My -- my deceased wife's father-in-law was a restauranteur up in -- up in Syracuse, New York. And, by the way, he tried to con- -- he had a -- had a restaurant that was in a town called Auburn, about 20,000 people, which was at a flagship 24-hour-a-day restaurant that -- and he offered it to me, which I would have been making five times what I would in law school to try to keep me in Syracuse.
But I spent too many times at home hearing a -- in his home, hearing a phone call: ""The cook didn't come in? He's in a fight with his wife? What -- what's going on?""
Q: Exactly.
THE PRESIDENT: So I would -- God love you doing what you do.
Q: It's tough.
But all kidding aside, I think it really is a matter of people deciding now that they have opportunities to do other things. And there is a shortage of employees. People are looking to make more money and to bargain. And so I think your business and the tourist business is really going to be in a -- in a bind for a little while. And one of the things -- we're ending all those things that are the things keeping people back from going back to work, et cetera.
It'll be interesting to see what happens, but my gut tells me -- my gut tells me that part of it relates to -- you know, you can make a good salary as a waiter or waitress. One of my sister-in-laws is -- of five sisters -- makes a very good salary. She works in Atlantic City. That's where she's -- she's from. But it is -- there's a lot of people who -- who are looking to change their -- their occupation, I think. But I could be wrong.
MR. LEMON: Well, let me ask you, because he's -- John is looking to hire people. He's got 39 restaurants across the country.
THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
MR. LEMON: Is there anything you can do to help him out? I mean, he's -- he's got to get people in.
THE PRESIDENT: Well, John -- first of all, I -- you know, the thing we did to help John and the Johns out is provide billions of dollars to make sure they could stay open. Number one. So you all contributed to making sure John could stay in business. (Applause.) And we should. We should have done that, as we did for other industries.
But secondly, John, my guess is that people being $7, $8 an hour, plus tips, that -- that's -- I think, John, you're going to be finding -- (applause) -- 15 bucks an hour or more now. You know what I mean? But you may pay that already. You may pay that already.
MR. LEMON: Well, let me -- let me ask you, because everywhere I go, there isn't pretty much a shop in my town, a restaurant or whatever, where there isn't a ""for hire"" sign.
We were trying to check into the hotel; they couldn't get the rooms cleaned fast enough because they can't find staff. You mentioned something -- you said, ""We're going to end the things that may be keeping people back."" You think that's the unemployment benefits expanded?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, that was the argument it was. I -- I -- I don't think it did much. But the point is, it's argued that because the extended unemployment benefits kept people --they'd rather stay home and not work -- than go to work.
MR. LEMON: You don't think it hurt? Did that?
THE PRESIDENT: I see no evidence it had any serious impact on it. But you can argue -- let's assume it did. It's coming to an end, so it's not like we're in a situation where -- if that was it and it ends, then we're going to see John is going to have no problem.
But what I think is happening, folks, is, look, if you make less than fift- -- and I'm not saying, John, your folks make less than 15 -- you had good restaurants; that means their tips are good, people make a lot more than just what the -- what the minimum wage -- what the wage is being paid on with the -- put tips on top of it.
But, folks, look, here's the deal. Think about it: You know, if you have an -- we -- for example, I want to be able to -- one of my programs is to make sure that we have four more years of school that's free -- two years for three-year-olds and four-year-olds, because it's demonstrated that that -- (applause) -- increases significantly success, and community college.
MR. LEMON: Yeah.
THE PRESIDENT: Well, those folks are not likely to want to go and be waiters. There's nothing wrong being a waiter or waitress. My family has been engaged in that business. But the folks is --
And, lastly, if you make less than 15 bucks an hour working 40 hours a week, you're living below the poverty level. You're living below the poverty level. (Applause.)
MR. LEMON: I want to continue on and talk about -- this has to do with infrastructure, because you got applause when you mentioned the bridge earlier -- (laughs) -- and --
THE PRESIDENT: By the way, your congressman wants that bridge too. (Laughter.)
MR. LEMON: Todd Michael is here. He's a union electrician and a Democrat. He has a question about something that a lot of people in Cincinnati are concerned about.
Todd, take it away.
Q: As Mr. Lemon said, you have already touched on the subject of my question. The two most recent presidents -- past presidents -- had both campaigned using this region's Interstate 75 Bridge -- the Brent Spence Bridge that crosses the Iowa River -- as backdrops with a promise of an infrastructure bill that would help with the replacement.
President Biden, is it possible to bring Congress together to pass an infrastructure bill that builds a bridge that does not just benefit this region, but the entire I-75 corridor, from Michigan all the way to Florida?
THE PRESIDENT: The answer is absolutely, positively yes. (Applause.) I'm not just saying that. I'm not just saying that. And if you take a look at Ohio and Kentucky combined, there's well over -- there's thousands of bridges that need repair. Thousands. Thousands of bridges.
And we should be looking at it this way: It increases commerce, number one. But guess what? They're good-paying union jobs. Union. (Applause.) Union jobs.
And -- and -- and, by the way, can you ever think of a time -- those of you who are economists, who are -- who teach here, economics -- can you think of any time when the middle class did better, the wealthy didn't do really well?
I'm not being facetious now. I'm being deadly earnest. Can you think of any time that's occurred when the middle class does better? I'm tired of trickle down. I come from the corporate state of America. (Applause.)
And, by the way, I think you should be able to go out and make a billion dollars or a hundred million dollars if you have the capacity to do it. But I ask one thing: Pay your fair share. (Applause.) Just pay your fair share. I really mean it. And if you know anything about me, check it out: We have more corporations registered in Delaware than all the rest of America combined. Combined. Combined. I represented it for 36 years. I've never seen a time when we have the middle class growing that the wealthy didn't do very, very, very well.
MR. LEMON: Yeah.
THE PRESIDENT: So, that's what we have to do: Build it out and up, not just down.
MR. LEMON: Yeah. So that people like our next guest -- who just graduated from law school, by the way -- his name is Cory Marcum. He's a graduate from the University of Cincinnati Law School. And he --
THE PRESIDENT: He's a graduate, huh?
MR. LEMON: Excuse me, he's heading to law school -- I'm wrong -- in the fall.
Q: Yes. (Laughs.)
MR. LEMON: So, Cory, good luck in law school. And what's your question?
THE PRESIDENT: Your first year -- you wish you had already graduated. (Laughter.) I know. I -- me too.
Q: Yeah. (Laughs.) So, my question is: Last week, regarding the GOP's efforts to restrict voting rights, you said those efforts were, quote, ""the most dangerous threat to voting and the integrity of free and fair elections in our history,"" end quote. While you have condemned these attacks, you and congressional members of your party have done little to actually stop these assaults. If these efforts are really the most dangerous in our history, isn't it logical to get rid of the filibuster so we can protect our democracy and secure the right to vote? (Applause.)
THE PRESIDENT: I stand by what I said. Never before has there been an attempt by state legislatures to take over the ability to determine who won. Not count the votes -- determine who won.
We have election officials across the board that they're deciding to push out of the way. And if, in fact, tomorrow -- let's say we're running last time and we're -- these laws had been in effect that are -- these changes. In Georgia, the Georgia legislature -- you know, Biden won by multiple thousand votes; they could say, ""We don't think it was legit."" And the state legislature votes, ""We're going send electors up to Congress to vote for Trump, not Biden."" That's never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever been tried before. This is Jim Crow on steroids what we're talking about.
And so, it takes -- to go to your second point, I've been saying for a long, long time: The abuse of the filibuster is pretty overwhelming. When I got to the United States Senate at a time when we had guys like Jim Eastland and Strom Thurmond and Robert F. Byrd and a whole range of people who were very, very, very, very, very, very conservative on race, to say the least -- even then, if you were to filibuster, you had to stand on the floor and hold the floor. And that's why Strom, I think, set the record at 24 straight hours or something. Don't hold me to the number. But, you know, so you had to take -- there were significantly fewer filibusters in those days. In the middle of the civil rights movement.
MR. LEMON: But let me -- let me talk to you about that.
THE PRESIDENT: Well, let me finish my answer, because I'll tell you what I'd do. I would go back to that where you have to maintain the floor. You have to stand there and talk and hold the floor. (Applause.) You can't just say that now.
MR. LEMON: I understand that. But what difference is that if you hold the floor for, you know, a day or a year? What difference does it make?
Here's the thing for me: You talked about people -- and this is important for people who look like me. My grandmother would sit around when I was a kid, fifth grade -- (applause) -- had a fifth-grade education. I learned that she couldn't read when I was doing my homework. And she would tell me stories about people asking her to count the number of jellybeans in the jar or the soap.
And so why is protecting the filibuster -- is that more important than protecting voting rights, especially for people who fought and died for that? (Applause.)
THE PRESIDENT: No. It's not. I want to see the United States Congress, the United States Senate, pass S.1 and S.4, the John Lewis Act, and get it on my desk so I can sign it. (Applause.)
But here's the deal: What I also want to do -- I want to make sure we bring along not just all the Democrats; we bring along Republicans, who I know know better. They know better than this.
And what I don't want to do is get wrapped up, right now, in the argument of whether or not this is all about the filibuster or --
Look, the American public, you can't stop them from voting. You tried last time. More people voted last time than any time in American history, in the middle of the worst pandemic in American history. More people did. (Applause.) And they showed up. They're going to show up again. They're going to do it again.
But what I want to do is I'm trying to bring the country together. And I don't want the debate to only be about whether or not we have a filibuster or exceptions to the filibuster or the -- going back to the way the filibuster had to be used before.
MR. LEMON: But isn't that the only way you're going to get it done right now?
THE PRESIDENT: No, I don't believe that. I think we can get it done.
MR. LEMON: If you -- if you -- you agree with the former president; he has called -- as you call him, your ""old boss"" -- that it's ""a relic of Jim Crow.""
THE PRESIDENT: It is.
MR. LEMON: If it's a relic of Jim Crow, it's been used to fight against civil rights legislation historically, why protect it?
THE PRESIDENT: There's no reason to protect it other than you're going to throw the entire Congress into chaos and nothing will get done.
MR. LEMON: Right.
THE PRESIDENT: Nothing at all will get done. And there's a lot at stake. The most important one is the right to vote. That's the single most important one. And your vote counted, and counted by someone who honestly counts it.
But it goes beyond that. For example, wouldn't -- wouldn't my friends on the other side love to have a debate about the filibuster instead of passing the recovery act? Or wouldn't they love doing it instead of being in a position where we provide for -- how many of you have children under the age of 17? Raise your hand. Guess what? You're getting a lot of money in a monthly check now, aren't you? (Applause.)
No, you deserve -- (applause) -- no, no, no, I really mean it. Republicans used to fight for it as well. It's called the Child Tax Credit. If you have a child under the age of seven, you get 300 bucks a month -- 350 bucks a month. If you have a child under -- between 7 and 17, you get a total of 200 bucks a month. And guess what? It's cutting child poverty in half. In half. (Applause.)
MR. LEMON: Mr. President, I want to talk about something else that affects people a lot, and to children as well. The next question -- and it's about gun violence. This is from a paralegal and she's an advocate. Her name is Andrea Solis Canto. She's a Democrat.
Andrea, go ahead.
THE PRESIDENT: I used to be a public defender, kid. Thanks for what you're doing.
Q: (Laughs.) Thank you. So, gun violence has been on the rise across the country, and as a recent student and young professional living in Over-the-Rhine, I've seen this firsthand. Gun violence has taken the lives of so many young students and young people. I'm tired, and I want to see change that's going to make our cities, like Cincinnati, safer.
So, how will you address gun violence, from a federal point of view, to actually bring about change and make our local cities safer?
THE PRESIDENT: Now, I'm not being a wise guy. There's no reason you should -- have you seen my gun violence legislation I've introduced? As you know -- because you're so involved -- actually, crime is down; gun violence and murder rates are up. Guns. I'm the only guy that ever got passed legislation, when I was a senator, that made sure we eliminated assault weapons. The idea you need a weapon that can have the ability to fire 20, 30, 40, 50, 120 shots from that weapon -- whether it's a -- whether it's a 9-millimeter pistol or whether it's a rifle -- is ridiculous.
I'm continuing to push to eliminate the sale of those things, but I'm not likely to get that done in the near term. So here's what I've done: The people who, in fact, are using those weapons are acquiring them illegally -- illegally. And so what happens is, I've gotten ATF -- Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms -- I have them increase their budget and increase their capacity, along with the Justice Department, to go after the gun shops that are not abiding by the law of doing background checks. (Applause.) For real. That's number one.
Number two -- number two, we're in a position where you -- most of the cities -- and I don't know enough -- I think you've had a lot of gun violence here in Cincinnati. I think it was up to -- what? -- how many -- how many how dead? Five hundred over a period. Don't hold me to the number -- whatever it was. But my point is, all across the country. And it's not because the gun shops in the cities are selling these guns. They are either shadow gun dealers and/or gun shops that are not abiding by the law.
So, we're going to do major investigations and shut those guys down and put some of them in jail and -- for what they're doing: selling these weapons. There's also a thing called ""ghost guns"" that are being sold now and being used.
And so -- but in addition to that, what we have to do is we have to deal with a larger problem of the whole issue of law enforcement, generally. We're in a situation where, as much as we need to pass the Floyd Act and all that -- but here's the deal: Cops are having real trouble. They're not all bad guys; there's a lot of good guys. We need more policemen, not fewer policemen. But we need them involved in community policing. Community policing. (Applause.)
And when we did that, violent crime went down. All the criticism about the original crime bill -- well, guess what? Crime went down until we stopped doing community policing. So it's about getting -- we have availability now of over billion -- lots of money for cops to be able to hire psychologists, psychiatrists, as well as social workers to be engaged in the process. (Applause.)
MR. LEMON: Mr. President, we're going to put a period, maybe a comma right here because we have more to come. We got to take a quick break.
We'll be right back. More from President Joe Biden right after this. (Applause.)
(Commercial break begins.)
(Commercial break ends.)
MR. LEMON: Welcome back to our CNN Town Hall with the President of the United States, Joe Biden. I just -- I said we were going to put a comma on it because I want to continue this conversation.
You said that you need -- we need more police, right? Your words. So then, how do you respond to Republicans who try to paint you and your party as anti-police?
THE PRESIDENT: They're lying. (Applause.) No, look, never once -- we have to change police conduct. We have to have rules where things are open. We have to have rules where you can be able to determine what the background -- how many times a cop has violated the rules and be able to have access to what's going on in police departments, or the Justice Department can get involved in whether or not they have to change their pattern and practices.
I've always said that.
MR. LEMON: But what about defunding the police though? Because there's a ""Defund the Police.""
THE PRESIDENT: No, I've never -- never, never said defunding the police.
Look, I don't know any community, particularly the communities that are in the most need and the poorest and the most at risk, that don't want police. They want police, though, to look at them as equals. (Applause.) They want police to treat them in a way. They don't want police abusing.
And what happened was we got in the position where -- we used to have community policing where the cop -- my deceased son was the attorney general of the state of Delaware. And what we did when that original bill got passed was he would go down in the tough neighborhoods in my -- in my state -- in my city of Wilmington, which is overwhelming a minority city, and he'd go where the -- everybody can tell me where the best basketball is played in a playground here in this city. You know where it is; you know who the best ballplayers are; you know where they are.
He'd go down and sit there on the bench with his son, my -- my grandson, who's now 16, when he was 5 and 6 years old, and let them know he was there. He'd go over and knock on the window of the local cop, who was sitting there by himself in a squad car. I'd say, ""Get out of the car. Meet people.""
Because what used to happen was cops used to -- when first community policing came about -- they'd go in and they knew who the minister was in the church, they knew who owned the local liquor store, the local drugstore, the local grocery store. And they'd walk in and say, ""Look, I'm Joe Biden, and I'm going to be in this beat. Here's my cell number. You have a problem, call me. Here's my cell number.""
MR. LEMON: You said it's tough right now. You said police are up against -- well, they're up against the narrative that, you know, the country is anti-police, Democrats are anti-police, Joe Biden is anti-police. And then you have --
THE PRESIDENT: They aren't saying Joe Biden is anti-police. Cops are not saying that about Joe Biden. They know me, period. (Applause.)
MR. LEMON: Go on.
THE PRESIDENT: They're not saying. Republicans are saying it on the far -- I'm not going to -- anyway, it doesn't matter.
MR. LEMON: No, you can -- no, I want you to talk about this, because -- I mean --
THE PRESIDENT: No, look --
MR. LEMON: -- it's an important narrative. There is no more important issue, I think, right now than safety. You can rebuild a home. You can, you know, get a lot of things back. But, Mr. President, you cannot get back a life. And it --
THE PRESIDENT: That's exactly right. That's exactly right.
MR. LEMON: Yeah. And if police aren't doing their jobs, that increases --
THE PRESIDENT: Okay -- no, if police aren't doing their job, they should be held accountable. They should be fired if they're not doing their job. They should -- (applause) -- I have no -- I make no excuses for that.
We should have, for example, the George Floyd Act, where chokeholds are against the law, where a whole lot of things that are laid out in that legislation. And, by the way, I grew up in a neighborhood where you became a cop, a firefighter, or a priest. I wasn't qualified for any one of them, so here I am. (Laughter.)
But all kidding aside -- I'm not joking -- the guys that grew up in Scranton and Claymont, Delaware -- a steel town -- that's what we did. That's what they did. It's what my friends did.
And here's the point: The point is that they -- it doesn't justify maltreating the public. You have no right to do that. None. But now what's happening is, because they've become -- it's become so tough across the spectrum, we've actually cut down on a number of police, unrelated to anybody asking for it. The towns and cities aren't spending as much money on it. There is not as much federal money to hire police. And now, what's happening is police are not wanting to be a cop. Raise your hand if you want to be a cop now. What do you think, huh?
So what we got to do is we got to give them the help they need to be better at their job. The idea that you have someone sitting on a ledge, saying they're going to jump off a ledge, and you call the cop, and sending a guy or a woman who's a law enforcement officer, has a criminal justice degree, when you could send with him or her -- you could send with them a psychologist or a social worker, or somebody who can talk to them.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes!
THE PRESIDENT: No, I mean it. (Applause.) I'm serious.
MR. LEMON: Mr. President, I want to get to more questions now. I'm going to bring in Lynne Miller. She's an attorney and a Democrat.
Lynne, what's your question?
Q: Mr. President, the opioid crisis continues, and in this part of the country, it remains a huge problem. While the over-prescription of opioids is part of that problem, the drugs available in the black market are a growing issue as many of these contain fentanyl. That took the life of our son. How can your administration combat the issue of illegal opiates, many of which our young people buy online? Someone should bear responsibility for delivering death through the mail.
THE PRESIDENT: They should bear responsibility. You may or may not be aware: Even in the period when I was out of office, I was railing against the fact that drug companies were selling on the open market. There was one case -- what's really got me was you had two drugstores in small town in West Virginia having something like prescription for 4,000 pills. And it was obviously drug trafficking. That's what was going on.
So what we did was -- what they did was, they went after it. They just settled with Johnson & -- some of the drug companies who make opioids for twenty-si- -- was it $26 billion or 27. Today, if I'm not mistaken, the settlement took place.
But here's the deal: In addition to that, you have the Chinese sending fentanyl to Mexico, in large part, that's being mixed with opioids and/or heroin and other drugs, which is a dead-set killer of people.
And so, what we have to do -- I've had this encounter with China, and we're going to continue it. But we've also increased the number of DEA agents -- what we're doing at the border -- and how we're going to deal with ex- -- the intercepting that drug trade.
In addition to that, the Justice Department is moving on dealing with the whole opioid issue by increasing significantly the number -- the number of people in Justice Department working on this issue. And so, there's much more to say about it, but it is incredibly, incredibly dangerous.
MR. LEMON: Mr. President, I believe there's no better way to speak about this than --
THE PRESIDENT: (Inaudible) --
MR. LEMON: -- from experience. I don't think there's probably a family in this room who hasn't been affected by addiction. You've been very open about your son Hunter's problems with addiction. This is personal for you. And listen, I've dealt with it in -- within my own family. Every family deals with it. But this is personal for you.
THE PRESIDENT: Yes. And I'm so damn proud of my son. My son just wrote a book about how he overcame being addicted. And he did it, and he's doing it, and he is in good shape, thank God.
Here's the thing: We don't have nearly enough people involved in mental health and drug addiction services -- number one. (Applause.) Number one.
Number two -- number two, we shouldn't be sending people to jail for use; we should be sending them to mandatory rehabilitation. (Applause.) Mandatory rehabilitation.
Number three, when people are in fact in jail, they should be getting -- if that's not the main crime, but they also did -- they should be getting treatment while they are in jail.
Fourth, when people get out of jail -- whether it's for drug addiction or any other crime -- if they've served their time, they should have full access to everything from Pell Grants, to public housing, to -- to the like. (Applause.)
And, by the way -- and, by the way, folks, it's not just the right thing to do; it's the smart thing for us to do. Because what happens? Years ago, there was a guy named Arlen Specter from Pennsylvania. He and I introduced legislation that was a second chance. It would -- meant that, right now, when you get out of jail in most prisons in the states around the country -- what happens? -- you get a bus ticket and 25 bucks. You end up under the bridge, just like you did before. You're almost -- almost guaranteed to get back in -- in whatever -- whatever your problem was before.
So, they should have access to drug treatment. They should have access to housing. They should have access to whatever they qualify based on their income. And we should, in prisons as well, be training people differently.
But the mi- -- the big thing here is: We have to deal with the idea of addiction by providing for what we all know -- it's a disease of the brain.
MR. LEMON: Yeah.
THE PRESIDENT: It's a disease of the brain and has to be treated as such.
MR. LEMON: I think it's -- I think addiction and mental health issues have to be dealt with, just as if you break your arm and go to the doctor. We should be able to talk. There should be --
THE PRESIDENT: I agree.
MR. LEMON: -- there shouldn't be a stigma about it.
I want to bring in now Madeena Nolan. Madeena Nolan is a writer and editor. She's a Democrat.
Madeena, what's your question?
THE PRESIDENT: Hi, Madeena.
Q: Good evening, Mr. President. Vice President Harris said to Guatemalans, ""Don't come."" Recently, you have indicated you are in favor of refugees coming to this country. Could you please explain your administration's basic stance on immigration?
THE PRESIDENT: Yes. They should not come.
What we're trying to set up is, in the countries like in -- and particularly in the Northern Triangle -- Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, et cetera -- we are setting up in those countries: If you seek asylum in the United States, you can seek it from the country, from your -- in place. You can seek it from an American embassy. You can go in and seek and see whether or not you qualify. We've significantly increased the number of officers who can hear cases as to whether or not you qualify under the law for being here as a refugee. That is -- that's what we've done.
Thirdly, we have enabled a move, significantly, to change the number -- there were thousands of people in -- in custody with the Border Patrol. It's now cut by 90 percent, where there -- it's considerably down.
What I -- what I do say is: The one place you may heard that I'm talking about more immigrants coming in are those folks from Afghanistan who helped the American soldiers, who will be -- they and their family will be victimized very badly as a consequence of what happens if they're left behind. And so, we're providing for them to be able to see whether they qualify to meet this special requirement to be able to come to the United States as a refugee and as, ultimately, earning citizenship here. It seems to me it's the only decent thing that we can do.
In the meantime, we're going to send people to American bases, where they're not going to be able to leave the base while their cases are being determined -- whether they qualify -- and also other bases.
MR. LEMON: I want to talk to you about DACA. I got two questions on immigration. They're quick questions I want to ask you about. Because just last week, there was a federal judge who ruled the program unlawful, blocked it from accepting new applications. What do you say to DREAMers who are really worried about their futures here in the United States?
THE PRESIDENT: I'm not letting this go. Look, guys, let's just put it -- (applause) -- let's just put this -- you know, we talk about DREAMers sort of generically. Let's think about it now, what it really means: You're five years old. You're nine years old. Your mom or your dad says, ""I'm going to take you across the Rio Grande and we're going to illegally going to go into the United States."" What are you supposed to say? ""Not me. That's against the law""? I'm --no, I'm being -- I'm being deadly earnest. What can a kid say? What could they do? They come here with really no choice. And they're here, and they're good, good people. They've done well. (Applause.) Ten thousand of them were first-line workers. (Applause.) These are kids who've done well.
And so, what we're going to do is, first of all, appeal the case -- number one. But number two, we're going to make sure that -- a number of my Republican colleagues say they support the right of DREAMers to come. Let's call the question. They should be able to stay in the United States of America when a child comes (inaudible). (Applause.)
MR. LEMON: Mr. President, you've been the big guy for six months now in the White House. Can you take us behind the scenes -- something that was extraordinary or unusual that happened that stands out to you?
THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. ""Mr. President, you didn't close the door. Mr. President, what the hell are you going out at this time for?"" You know. (Laughter.) You know, it's -- it's a wonderful honor. As you can tell, I hope I have very good manners, but I'm not very hung up on protocol. (Laughter.)
And I -- and the Secret Service is wonderful. And because things are so -- (applause) -- and because things are so crazy out there, it is very hard to get comfortable like I would ordinarily be. For example, I think all of the -- all the help that's there, providing meals and all the rest -- I think they love us. We can say, ""Don't come in for breakfast. We can get our own breakfast."" Because I like to walk out in my robe and go in. (Laughter.) No, no, I'm not -- you think I'm joking. I'm not. You know what I mean?
And so it's just a -- you know, the only place I have felt like what the office connotes is when I went to Europe and watched the rest of the heads of state react to me -- not me, because I'm the President of the United States of America -- the United States of America.
And here's what happened: It's the first time I ever felt like -- you always hear say ""leader of the free world."" Well, I realize, when I'm sitting across from Putin, who I know, he knows who I am; I know who he is. He knows I mean what I say and can do what I say. He understands. It doesn't mean he will do it or not do it. But the point is it's the first time I've ever felt the notion that I am in the office that is the leader of the free world. And we must be the leader of the free world. If we don't do it, nobody good is likely to do it or has the capacity to do it. I really mean it. I genuinely mean it.
So, it's the thing, Don, that is the only time -- and, by the way, the first time I walked downstairs and they played ""Hail to the Chief,"" I wondered, ""Where is he?"" (Laughter.) No, you think I'm kidding. I'm not kidding. You know, I mean --
MR. LEMON: It's a great tune, isn't it?
THE PRESIDENT: It's a great tune, but I -- you know, you feel a little self-conscious. (Laughter.) But you think I'm kidding. I'm not.
But I am -- I am not at all self-conscious about the power that goes with the office as it relates to resolving issues. These are issues that I've dealt with my whole life. Whether I'm good or bad, I have more experience coming to the office than anyone who's ever held that office. I have done -- I've -- I've been deeply steeped in foreign policy, the justice system, the econo- -- not that I'm right. I don't mean that. But nothing has come before me where I've gone, ""Oh, my God, I never -- I never thought…""
You know, what the difference is -- I used to kid Barack -- he's a good friend -- President Obama. And, you know, at one point, I'd always be the -- I was always the last guy in the room, for real. On every important decision, I got to give my advice. I'd give it all away, but I'd be the last guy before I walked out. And one day, he thanked me. And I said, ""Mr. President, here's the deal: I should be paying you, not you me, because I get to give the advice, and then I get to leave."" (Laughter.)
No, I'm serious. Think about it. The one thing that is real, that is different -- I don't -- and I feel comfortable with it -- but is you're the last guy in the room.
MR. LEMON: Yeah.
THE PRESIDENT: You decide, ""Is the decision I'm about to make, will that cause war? Will that cause conflict? The decision I'm about to make, is that going to hurt people? Is it going to help people?"" That's the part that is different.
But the living conditions, I mean, it's such a great, great honor to live in the White House. But, quite frankly -- I kid the Vice President -- like, one day, Barack came over to NAVOBS -- it's called Naval Operations [sic] -- the Vice President's Residence -- which is on about, I guess, 80, 90 acres. And it's a beautiful, beautiful spot. And there's a fence around the whole property.
MR. LEMON: I bet you miss that, don't you?
THE PRESIDENT: I do. (Laughter.) And Barack came over and he said, ""This is great."" And I said, ""I'll tell you…"" And I said, ""Trade you only if the power goes with it.""
But the point is that, there, it was totally different. You could walk out in your shorts -- with a short-sleeve shirt on, and you can walk around and there wasn't anybody there. You can't walk out anywhere now. (Laughter.) But I'm not complaining. I'm trying to answer your question as honestly as I can.
MR. LEMON: Yeah.
THE PRESIDENT: I just -- it's the greatest honor, I think, could ever be bestowed on an American that a majority of American citizens said, ""I want you to lead the country."" And it's a great honor -- a great honor when you have presidents and prime ministers and the rest of the world saying, ""You know, what does the United States think?"" You're the leader of the free world.
I was able to go to the G7 and change their mind about a whole range of things. They never once had included China in any criticism on what was going on. They're very reluctant to be able to be in a position -- you and I have talked about this -- about whether or not they're going to do business with China in a way that, you know, pushes America aside.
All of a sudden, if you notice, we're getting a great deal -- not because of me, but because of the administration I put together. And America is back; traditional America is more back. And they're willing to follow us, I think. (Applause.)
Q: Well, Mr. President -- Mr. President, here's the deal. Mr. President, here's the deal: I'm the last guy that gets to ask you questions tonight.
THE PRESIDENT: Uh-oh.
MR. LEMON: Yeah. And then I get to leave. (Laughter.) Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT: Thanks, man.
MR. LEMON: I appreciate it.
THE PRESIDENT: Appreciate it. (Applause.)
MR. LEMON: We're so glad that you guys are here and that you got to ask questions to the President of the United States. Thank you so much.
Thank you to our audience, for everyone, for being here taking questions. Of course, thank you to the President of the United States. And we want to thank Mount St. Joseph University right here in Cincinnati, Ohio -- right? -- (applause) -- for housing us.

THE PRESIDENT: We answered enough questions today. The only reason I'm stopping: I feel badly you're here this hour of the night.

Remarks Prior to a Cabinet Meeting and an Exchange with Reporters
","
THE PRESIDENT: Well, look, today -- today's Cabinet meeting, I want to give a brief progress report as to where I think we are and the job you're doing in the first six months.
First, the pandemic. I know folks are watching the number of cases rising again and wondering, quite frankly, what it means to them. But overall -- overall, COVID-19 deaths are down dramatically -- dramatically. And these last six months, about 90 percent down due to our vaccination program. And I want to thank you all for the great job you did in getting that done.
But we have to stay vigilant, especially with the Delta variant that's out there. While COVID-19 cases are rising, virtually all of the COVID death -- virtually all of the COVID deaths and hospitalizations are from unvaccinated people. Let me say it again: Virtually all are from unvaccinated people.
And that means the safest thing to do is to get vaccinated -- get vaccinated. And that's why we're focusing, on our next phase, on getting the unvaccinated vaccinated. I know it seems like a constant uphill climb, but it's gradually -- we're making progress, but we've got a way to go yet.
Secondly, the economy. Yesterday -- that I spoke of the historic economic progress we've made, which starts with the American Rescue Plan: shots in arms that saved a lot of lives; checks and tax cuts to give them just a little extra breathing room -- ordinary Americans; and -- and lower healthcare costs, just when so many Americans needed that help. And it's helped create 3 million -- 3 million jobs -- more than any administration has done in the first six months of being in office -- again, thanks to all of you.
And with our Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework and our Build Back Better plan, I think we can turn this -- this great movement into a economic boom for some time to come. And I really mean that. I think we're in a cusp -- not only getting us out of the hole, but setting us on a -- on a path that's going to generate significant continued economic growth.
And the American people are overwhelmingly supportive of our plans -- that's support that a lot of our friends and the other team kind of miss. The polling data shows that they strongly support -- strongly support our effort for infrastructure.
I think they're a little tired of Infrastructure Week for four years in a row. I think we're on the verge of me being able to get something really done -- rebuilding roads and bridges; replacing lead water pipes; delivering high-speed Internet to every American -- rural and inner-city; and taking on the climate crisis with -- with American jobs.
And they want us to build back -- to build back better. They don't know the name necessarily, but they know that they support universal pre-K and two years of community college; paid leave and childcare, which is essentially a significant tax cut for working-class families; and allowing Medicare to negotiate lower drug costs, which will significantly reduce drug prices across the board for people.
And they support asking the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans and corporate America not to pay more than they should; just begin to pay their fair share, just step up a little bit.
The idea that 50 of the largest corporations in America pay no tax, it's -- I -- I think people should be able to be millionaires and billionaires if they have the ideas, but, Lord's sake, the idea -- let's start paying your fair share.
And third thing is, there are -- and, by the way, there's overwhelming evidence, in the polling data, they support what we're doing -- is how to pay for these programs.
Thirdly, restoring American leadership in the world. I know you all have -- those of you who've travelled around the world -- I know our Ambassador to the United Nations knows it full well -- that America has -- is really behind the eight-ball the last four years. We've lost a lot of our standing. I don't have to tell that to my buddy sitting to my right here -- the Secretary of State. He understands it well.
And as I've said before, we are -- we are defining -- in a defining competition right now for the 21st century -- for the second quarter of the 21st century -- with China and many other nations. And many of these nations believe that autocracy is the future; that democracies cannot compete with autocracies because it's so hard -- things are moving so rapidly, technologically and otherwise, that democracies can't get the act together enough to get a consensus on how to move.
Well, I reject that most -- notion completely, and I think the vast majority of American people do as well.
You know, in my conversations and meetings with world leaders -- just coming back from, I guess, about eight, nine days over there, ending with a -- a meeting with Putin -- you know, I'm making it absolutely clear that democracy is more capable -- more capable, and America is back, whether it's helping vaccinate the world.
And we're not just vaccinating ourselves. We're going to do -- we're going to vac- -- help vaccinate the world. We're building back better to create jobs and grow the middle class not just at home, everywhere. It's in our interests the economic -- the economies of these other nations grow.
And we're going to lead the fight against the climate crisis and tackling -- tackling the challenges of cybersecurity. We've been very clear to our -- our -- other nations as to what we expect in terms of their conduct.
And finally, there's much more to be done and so much more to do -- tackling voting rights, which is an existential threat to democracy right now. The things that are being asked are just beyond the pale. And the Vice President has been working hard on this issue and is going to continue to -- we all are -- but there's much more to do. We have to tackle the immigration problem, which we're working really hard to get done in a humane and serious way. Police reform and crime.
And the bottom line is: We're delivering on our promises. We have to deliver on all of the promises we made. Because I think we're in a situation where the vast majority of the public agrees with the essence of what we're trying to do.
And so, I just think that we're showing there's nothing that America is unable to do when we do it together.
And so, you know, I think it's time for us to -- to stop now so we can get started with our meeting. So, are you ready, folks, to go to work?
PARTICIPANTS: Yes.
Q: Mr. President, quickly: Do you think vac- -- do you think vaccinated people should start wearing masks?
Q: (Cross-talk.)
THE PRESIDENT: Guys, we're -- we're going to work now. We're -- we'll have plenty of time to (inaudible).

Remarks Honoring the Super Bowl LV Champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers
","
THE PRESIDENT: Well, good morning, I think -- still ""good morning."" And it's great to see everybody here. I want to thank the -- the representatives here. The Second Gentleman is here. Representative Castor, Crist --
PARTICIPANT: (Inaudible.)
THE PRESIDENT: Okay, you got -- (laughs). I'll tell you, that Florida thing is something else. Anyway. (Laughter.)
And Soto and Murphy and Franklin. And one of my best friends in the world -- now he's coming back from outer space -- Bill Nelson, who runs NASA now.
We're here today to congratulate and welcome to the White House the Super Bowl Champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers. (Applause.) To the players, the coaches, and the Glazer family -- my good friends -- it's an honor to have you here.
We have to say that the fans down in Western Florida are having a pretty good year this year. I tell you, you know, the Stanley Cup and -- in addition to the Super Bowl. But, you know, we're making a pretty strong case to start calling Tampa the ""City of Champions.""
And -- (applause) -- the -- this Buccaneer team is a testament of the fact that it's never too late to come together and achieve extraordinary things. Three quarters of the way through the season, they found themselves in the middle of the pack: seven wins and five losses.
But this is a team that didn't fold and always got up, dug deep. They won their last four games of the season and then stormed through the playoffs -- winning on the road in Washington, New Orleans, and Green Bay -- and capping it all off back home in Tampa to become the first team to win the Super Bowl on their home turf in a decisive victory against the defending champs, the Kansas City Chiefs.
You know, it's an incredible run by one of the most well-rounded teams in recent memory. A pair of All-Pro linebackers. Star pass rushers. A dangerous secondary. A dominant offensive line. And a legendary tight end who gave up what, I'm told, was a promising career to return to -- acting career -- to return to the game.
And most importantly, you've got a star receiver from Delaware. I'm mildly prejudiced about that. (Laughter and applause.) Where's Chris? Where are you, Chris? There you go. (Applause.)
I called him before the game to tell him -- to give him some tips on how to run some patterns. That was a -- (laughter).
But, you know, born in Pennsylvania, raised in Delaware. Where I come from, that's a heck of a combination, man. You know, Chris and I had a chance to speak before the Super Bowl. And I know, like me, he takes a lot of pride in his home state of Delaware. Chris, you're inspiring a whole lot of kids back home in Delaware.
And he went to a -- by the way, he went to a high school called Middletown -- a perennial winner of the state championship. But I pointed out to him, when my son, Hunter, was a senior, he went to my Alma Mater's high school named -- by the way, all sit down. What are we -- just standing? I'm sorry. (Laughter.)
I -- you know, and I told him my son scored the scoring touchdown at Archmere and won the state championship that year. But, anyway, that's -- we don't -- we don't count those things. You know, I've never met an athlete that doesn't remember every damn play he made.
And, of course, two other guys worth mentioning: the coach and the quarterback. You know, a lot has been made about the fact that we have the oldest coach ever to win a Super Bowl and the oldest quarterback to win the Super Bowl.
Well, I'll tell you right now: You won't hear any jokes about that from me. As far as I'm concerned, there's nothing wrong with being the oldest guy to make it to the mountaintop. That's how I look at it. (Applause.)
And, Tom, looking at you, you've got about 20 more years left. You're just about the best ever to play. And making it to 10 Super Bowls in the last 20 years -- that ain't bad, man. (Laughter.) I'll tell you what, we've never seen anything like it in the game.
And, of course, these guys all know that sports are more than just a game. It's something -- some of my strongest memories, most enduring memories and lessons and cherished friendships come from the days I played -- not went anywhere near anybody on that stage. I started in grade school playing in CYO league.
And I'll never forget getting knocked out when I was in fifth grade, and my dad -- walking off -- he said, ""Get up. Get up. Get up. Unless something is broken, get up."" Well, I think that's what sports tell you: You just get up. You get up.
I went to the University of Delaware to play football, although it didn't very do much for my career -- I didn't do very well. But, you know, I found out that your career can be embellished a little over time. It's an amazing kind of thing.
You know, there's an awards banquet that, many years later -- which is called the Timmie Awards -- was it? -- and was held here in Washington. Supreme Court Justices and Presidents would show up to this big banquet. And the University of Delaware football program received the award, and I had a chance to introduce a Hall of Fame coach, one of my -- the backfield coach when I played. I didn't play much. His name was Tubby Raymond. And -- and so, I got up and I said, ""Here is my coach, Tubby Raymond."" Made -- said some nice things about Tubby.
Tubby was really, kind of, nervous and -- standing in front of Presidents and Supreme Court Justices and so many distinguished people. And he went up on -- on to talk about what an incredible ball player I was at the University of Delaware. (Laughter.) It was amazing. It was amazing. That's why I decided to run for President. I figured, if he was still around and I'd get to be elected President, I would've been an All-American. (Laughter.) I could've been big. I could've been big.
But all kidding aside, you guys did it the hard way. And I hope you all know just how important it was for -- after such a tough year for the nation. In the middle of a long, dark winter, every Sunday, people were able to sit down and watch you play. You created memories that helped folks make it through and believe that we could get back to normal again. And you did it as a team, trailblazing, including the first team with two women full-time coaching positions. (Applause.)
And realizing that of the -- of the 25 or 26 Glazer grandchildren and about 24 of them being women -- you had no choice. It's about time they stepped up. Right, guys?
Anyway, all kidding aside, the step -- your team stepped up off the field, too, donating millions of meals to families in need; helping Americans exercise their sacred right to vote, including at Raymond James Stadium. Your stadium also became a lifeline for families in Tampa Bay this spring, administering nearly 200,000 vaccine shots. And you all who don't have a shot, man: Get one, okay?
PARTICIPANT: Amen.
THE PRESIDENT: Get one. Get one. (Applause.)
And you're saving lives -- helping us get back our lives and loved ones.
And I want to thank the NFL for setting strong vaccination goals so fans can go see a game without it becoming a super-spreader event.
Getting vaccinated is about staying healthy and understanding that no one is invincible, even if you are young and you're fit. It's about looking out for those and the frontline workers out there, like the ones the team played in front of on Super Bowl Sunday.
Those workers remind us of a quintessential lesson about sports and America itself. That no matter how much and how many times we get knocked down, we always get up. We come back. We come back stronger together and achieve incredible things -- just like your team did, just like we're doing as a country.
So, congratulations, and thank you all for being here. Good luck to you all this season. And now let me bring up Bryan to say a few words. (Applause.)
MR. GLAZER: Mr. President, on behalf of our family, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers coaches, players, and staff, and all of our loyal fans, thank you for hosting us today. It's an honor for us to be at the White House.
For our family and fans, this day has been nearly 20 years in the making. Because despite this being our second Super Bowl Championship, this our first visit to the White House. In 2003, following our Super Bowl 37 victory, there were world events that prevented us to visit. So that makes today even more special.
And we're here today because this team did the impossible: new players, including a new quarterback; no offseason mini camps; no preseason; limitations on meetings,; rules and regulations were changing every day. But they stayed focused and went on to win their final eight games, as the President spoke about, and became the first team to win the Super Bowl at home. Amazing.
It's only fitting that as we enter the 46th season in Tampa Bay Buccaneer history that we celebrate it with the 46th President of the United States.
We start this season with only one goal in mind: It's to come back here next summer and spend a Super Bowl victory again with you. (Applause.)
MR. ARIANS: Thank you, Mr. President, for giving us this day. It -- I get emotional, but it's very, very special. This is actually my third time; it never gets old.
And I want to thank our coaches, our players, our entire organization -- men, women that did such a great job last year of coming together and banding together -- not to beat the other team; we had to beat the virus first. And you sacrificed more than any team I've ever been around -- players, coaches, your families -- to make sure that we had our team on the field every Sunday.
And it's a great compliment to all of you. I can't say enough about our owners, the Glazer family. They're the best owners I've ever known and ever been around. Our players are outstanding. They do what they're supposed to do on and off the field because they take care of each other.
We live by three words: trust, loyalty, and respect. We don't have any rules. If you have those, you'll have accountability and you'll be able to do anything you want. One team, one cause.
I hope the Senate and the House start helping you. (Applause.) One team, one cause.
All right. Again, thank you all for having us here. Thank you, Mr. President. And Go Bucs. (Applause.) And Tom has got some stuff to say.
MR. BRADY: Thank you, Mr. President. It's certainly an honor to be here. Thank you very much for your hospitality your entire staff has given us today. I think what -- behind me is an amazing group of players. We have a bunch of coaches and staff here sitting down.
And it was actually a very challenging season for a lot of reasons, but we bonded together, we worked really hard, we put all our individual agendas aside, and we came together as a team.
And sports has an amazing way of bringing people together. If you look at us, we're all a little bit different ages. I'm a little older than most of them. But we come from a lot of different places across the country, a lot of different schools, a lot of different backgrounds, but we love each other; we're committed to one another. And when you do that, amazing things happen.
And these guys are amazing group of men. It didn't look great there at one point. We were seven and five, struggling a little bit, as the President alluded to. But we found our rhythm. We got on a roll.
Not a lot of people, you know, think that we could have won. And, in fact, I think about 40 percent of the people still don't think we won.
THE PRESIDENT: I understand that. (Laughter.)
MR. BRADY: You understand that, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT: I understand that.
MR. BRADY: Yeah. And personally, you know, it's nice for me to be back here. We had a game in Chicago where I forgot what down it was. I lost track of one down in 21 years of playing, and they started calling me ""Sleepy Tom."" (Laughter.) Why would they do that to me?
THE PRESIDENT: I don't know. (Laughter.)
MR. BRADY: So, it's great to be -- you know, we're on the eve of football season. We start, tomorrow, practice. And we're going to do everything we can to work to achieve another one of those Lombardi trophies.
It's a different group of men. It'll be a different challenge, but we're excited for it. We're excited for the opportunity to compete and work hard and show everyone what we're made of.
So, we're not going to throw the Super Bowl trophy this time, Cam, but we're going to offer President Biden a special presentation from Mr. Glazer. And then we're going to challenge 11 of us, 11 White House interns to game of football here on the lawn, and we intend to run it up on you guys, so -- (laughter) -- get ready to go. Thank you. (Applause.)
(The President is presented with a Buccaneers jersey.) (Applause.)
THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you, man. Unusual number, huh? Forty-six. (Laughter.) Thank you, thank you, thank you. (Applause.)

Remarks Prior to a Meeting with King Abdullah II bin Al Hussein of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan
","
PRESIDENT BIDEN: Well, I'm -- I want to welcome back to the White House a good, loyal, and decent friend, His Majesty. And we've been hanging out together for a long time. I met him back when he was in the situation his son is, when his father was alive and I was a young senator. And it's good to have him back in the White House.
You know, I want to thank you, Your Majesty, for your enduring and strategic relationship with the United States. You've always been there, and we will always be there for Jordan.
And in addition to that, we -- we were talking -- we had an opportunity to speak just a moment in the Diplomatic Room. And we talked about how our -- our children and my children were -- had to finish off their senior year in college on Zoom.
And we talked about the COVID pro- -- crisis. We were able to be a little bit of help to Jordan, and we hope to be able to help some more and -- in this pandemic.
And I also want to thank you for your vital leadership in the Middle East. You live in a tough neighborhood. And the fact is, I look forward to hearing from His Majesty about the pressing challenges that -- (a cellphone disrupts the event) -- that Jordan faces. And whoever's -- is that a call for me on the phone? (Laughter.) And we're going to continue to stre- -- to strengthen our bilateral cooperation.
The world is changing. And you always -- they always kid me. I'm always quoting Irish poets. It says -- there was a famous poem -- ""All changed, changed utterly. A terrible beauty has been born."" But a lot has changed and a lot of opportunity, but also a lot of difficulty we're going to have to work our way through.
So, welcome. Welcome, welcome, welcome.
KING ABDULLAH II: Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you.
Mr. President, thank you, as always, for the kindness that you showed me. And as you alluded to, I had the honor and the privilege of knowing you with my father decades ago. And so this is very warming for me to be able to see you in this position and to thank you for the generosity you always have shown me and my country.
You alluded to supporting us with vaccines. So, on behalf of Jordan and the people of Jordan, thank you so much for the leadership you've shown not only in supporting our country, but fighting COVID internationally. You've set the standard for the rest of us to follow.
We come together as always strong partners. We have, as you said, many challenges in our part of the world. I think many of us leaders from our part of the world will do the heavy lifting, which is what we need to do, on behalf of the United States. But you can always count on me, my country, and many of our colleagues in the region. A lot to do, sir, but with your leadership, we will prevail.
PRESIDENT BIDEN: Well, as my grandfather used to say: ""With the grace of God and the goodwill to the neighbors,"" we'll be able to get a lot done.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

Remarks on the Economy and an Exchange with Reporters
","
THE PRESIDENT: Well, good morning. Tomorrow marks exactly six months since my administration began. I think it's a fitting moment to take a look at our economy -- where we were six months ago, what we've achieved since then, and what I believe we've -- I believe where we're headed.
Before I took office, there was a lot of folks out there -- a lot of folks out there making some pretty bold predictions about how things would turn out. You might remember some of the predictions. That if I became President, we'd, quote, ""see a depression the likes of which we've never seen."" End of quote.
Well, it's true that the economy was sputtering before I got here, adding only 60,000 jobs per month for the three months before I was sworn in. But now, six months later, we've changed that.
We've gone from 60,000 jobs per month to 60,000 jobs every three days -- more than 600,000 jobs per month since I took office. More than 3 million new jobs all told. That's the fastest growth, I'm told, at this point in any administration's history.
Another prediction -- that is my favorite one, I must add -- is that if I got elected, I'd bring the end to capitalism. (Laughs.) I never understood that one, but we've heard -- we've heard it an awful lot. Well, in six months into my administration, the U.S. economy has experienced the highest economic growth rate in nearly 40 years.
And we know we've -- and now we knew that we needed to launch a war-time effort to get the -- America vaccinated and pass a powerful American Rescue Plan.
We did both those things. And now, the forecasters have doubled their projections for growth this year in the economy to 7 percent or higher. In fact, the U.S. is the only developed country in the world where growth projections today are stronger than they were before the pandemic hit.
At the same time, companies across the country are giving workers a raise. Unusual thing. (Laughs.) And the number of new unemployment claims has been cut by more than half since I took office.
And by the way, two weeks ago, I issued a major executive order promoting fair and open competition, which is the cornerstone -- the cornerstone of American capitalism, banning non-compete clauses that suppress workers' wages; lowering the price of things like hearing aids, prescription drugs, Internet service; along with dozens of other actions.
Folks, it turns out capitalism is alive and very well. We're making serious progress to ensure that it works the way it's supposed to work: for the good of the American people.
So, for all those predictions of doom and gloom, six months in, here's where we stand: record growth, record job creation, workers getting hard-earned breaks.
Look, we've brought this economy back from the brink. And we designed our strategy not only to provide for a temporary boost, but to lay the foundation for a long-term boom that brings everyone along.
You know, that's why we designed the American Rescue Plan to help not just all those -- everyone at once, but over the course of a full year and beyond so we could help families and small businesses weather the ups and downs of our -- as the economy recovers from an historic pandemic. And I -- there are going to be ups and downs.
We saw a great example of that just last week. For the first time, monthly payments began going out to nearly every working family raising a child in the United States of America. Thanks to the expanded Child Tax Credit in the American Rescue Plan: $300 a month going out for each child under the age of six, and $250 for every child 6 through 17, every month for the next six months, with more coming in the spring.
That money is a game-changer. For some, it's a lifesaver. Think of the single mom, struggling to put food on the table each month. The parent who has to tell their kid, ""I'm sorry, honey, but we can't afford those dance classes or the sports team you want to play on this fall. We can't do it."" You know, they can't wait for the credit against their taxes to be coming next year as a tax credit. They need cash in their pockets today.
For families with the least, this money will do the most -- dramatically reducing child poverty in America. And for millions of middle-class families, it will give them a little bit of breathing room every month. That's just one example of how we're building an economy from the bottom up and the middle out.
But despite that progress, we cannot afford to be complacent. We know that our economic recovery hinges on getting the pandemic under control.
You know, and by fully vaccinating 160 million Americans, 80 percent of our seniors, we've fundamentally changed the course of the pandemic -- from one that threatens all Americans, to a disease that has the most severe impacts only on the unvaccinated people in the country. But we can't let up, especially since and because of the Delta variant, which is more transmis- -- more transmissible and more dangerous.
Unfortunately, cases are now rising, particularly in communities with very low vaccination rates. Just four states account for nearly 40 percent -- four states, 40 percent of all cases last week. Virtually all hospitalizations and deaths are occurring among unvaccinated Americans. These tragedies are avoidable.
The data couldn't be clearer: If you're fully vaccinated, you have a high degree of protection against severe illness, hospitalization, and death. If you're unvaccinated, you are not protected. So, please, please get vaccinated. Get vaccinated now. It works. It's safe. It's free. It's convenient.
You know, this virus doesn't have to hold you back any longer. It doesn't have to hold our economy back any longer. But the only way we put it behind us is if more Americans get vaccinated.
We also know that as our economy has come roaring back, we've seen some price increases. Some folks have raised worries that this could be a sign of persistent inflation. But that's not our view. Our experts believe and the data shows that most of the price increases we've seen are -- were expected and expected to be temporary.
The reality is, you can't flip the global economic light back on and not expect this to happen. As demand returns, there's going to be global supply chain challenges. We've seen that in semi-conductors, which are used in automobiles. That global shortage has slowed vehicle production, creating a temporary spike in car prices. That's a real challenge. And my administration is doing everything we can to address it. But again, these disruptions are temporary.
Lumber prices are another example. They spiked early in our recovery, but in recent weeks, they've began to fall -- they've fallen by more than 50 percent.
In the hospitality industry, prices are returning to where they used to be. Economists call all of these things ""transitory effects."" And they account for about 60 percent of the price increases we've seen over the last few months.
Now, I want to be clear: My administration understands that if we were to ever experience unchecked inflation over the long term that would pose real challenges to our economy. So while we're confident that isn't what we are seeing today, we're going to remain vigilant about any response that is needed.
As I made clear to Chairman Powell of the Federal Reserve when we met recently, the Fed is independent. It should take whatever steps it deems necessary to support a strong, durable economic recovery. But whatever different views some might have on current price increases, we should be united on one thing: passage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework, which we shook hands on. We shook hands on it. And my Build Back Better plan will be a force for achieving lower prices for Americans looking ahead. It's another reason why these investments are so important.
If we make a prudent, multi-year investments in better roads, bridges, transit systems, and high-speed Internet, and a modern, resilient electric grid, here's what will happen: It breaks up the bottlenecks in our economy. Goods get to consumers more rapidly and less expensively. Small businesses create and innovate much more seamlessly. If we increase the availability of quality, affordable childcare, eldercare, paid leave, more people will enter the workforce.
These steps will enhance our productivity -- raising wages without raising prices. That won't increase inflation. It will take the pressure off of inflation, give a boost to our workforce, which leads to lower prices in the years ahead.
So, if your primary concern right now is inflation, you should be even more enthusiastic about this plan. And as we promote -- as we promote fair competition in our economy through the executive order I mentioned, it will drive down prices even further. New businesses will get in the game, competing against those giant corporations who have been free to ramp up prices because they haven't had any real competition.
Look, the bottom line is this: What the best companies do and what we as a country should do is make smart, sustainable investments with appropriate financing to make this nation more productive, to advance America's leadership on clean energy to win the jobs of the future while meeting the threat of climate change, and to ensure that all working Americans benefit from the growth they're helping produce.
The independent experts who have analyzed my plans have found that they would do just that: expand output and enable millions of Americans to enter the labor workforce now, just this year -- not just for the next -- but not just this year, but for decades in the future. It's not temporary.
This is the best strategy to create millions of jobs and lift up the middle-class families and grow wages and keep prices affordable for the long term.
What we can't do is go back to the same old trickle-down theories that gave us nearly $2 trillion in deficit-financed corporate tax giveaways that did nothing to make our economy more productive or resilient. The same people who cheered on that approach are now telling us it isn't [is] a problem if big companies have actually to compete for workers and offer them a fair wage with some dignity.
I could not disagree more. We can't go back to the old, failed thinking. We need to grow the economy from the bottom up and the middle out, as I've said before.
The investments I'm proposing are investments the American people want and investments that our country needs. And if we get this done, a wide range of independent forecasters project that it will have an incredibly significant impact on GDP and jobs -- good-paying jobs with prevailing wages. And the majority of these jobs will go to people without a college degree.
I've said it before, and it's true: This is a blue-collar blueprint for building an American economy back. Simply put, we can't afford not to make these investments. And we're going to pay for them responsibly as well, by ensuring that our largest corporations and the very wealthiest among us pay their fair share by reforming our international tax system with a minimum global tax, which we've led the world to agree to.
Let me close with this: When I arrived in office, it had been a long time since the government had worked for the people. Things had been great for big corporations and folks at the top. Those 55 major corporations that paid zero in income tax while making billions in profits, they had no complaints.
But when I took office, I made a commitment -- a commitment to the American people that we were going to change that paradigm so working families could have a fighting chance again to get a good education; to get a good job and a raise; to take care of the elderly parent or the child with the disability and still be able to go out and earn a good living; to stop losing hours of their lives stuck in traffic because the streets are crumbling; or waiting for slow, spotty Internet to connect them to the world.
That's what the economy we're building is all about. That's why we passed the American Rescue Plan. And that's why we need the investment of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework and my Build Back Better plan.
Our economy has come a long way over the last six months. We can't slow down now. We can make this boom we're experiencing today one that will ensure that all Americans have an opportunity to share in it for years to come. And we can show the world that American democracy can deliver for the people.
I look forward to continuing to build this economy. And I'm incredibly optimistic about what we're going to be able to build together in the next six months and the years to come.
Thank you all for listening. May God bless you. And I'll take a few questions.
Q: Mr. President, you said last week that companies and platforms like Facebook are ""killing people"" by letting them --
THE PRESIDENT: Let me (inaudible) precisely what I said. I'm glad you asked me that question. One, I had just read that -- on the Facebook -- Facebook pointed out that -- it was pointed out that Facebook, of all the misinformation, 60 percent of that misinformation came from 12 individuals. That's what the article said.
So, I was asked that question about what do I think is happening. Facebook isn't killing people; these 12 people who are out there giving misinformation -- anyone listening to it is getting hurt by it. It's killing people. It's bad information.
My hope is that Facebook, instead of taking it personally -- that somehow I'm saying Facebook is killing people -- that they would do something about the misinformation -- the outrageous informa- -- misinformation about the vaccine. That's what I meant.
Q: Have they done enough in your opinion to stop --
THE PRESIDENT: I haven't -- to be completely honest with you, I don't know that they did anything today. Up to -- over the weekend, I don't think they had. But I don't know. I don't know the answer to that question.
Q: Will you hold them accountable if they don't do more to stop the spread?
THE PRESIDENT: I'm -- when you say ""hold accountable,"" I just want to -- I'm not trying to hold people account- -- I'm trying make people to look at themselves. Look in the mirror. Think about that misinformation going to your son, your daughter, your relatives, someone you love. That's what I'm asking.
All the way in the back.
Q: Yes, thank you, Mr. President. At what point would you consider inflation unchecked to a point at which you would either consider taking action or you would want to see the Fed take action?
And secondly, why do you believe that the budget bill is appropriate legislation for a pathway to citizenship?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, first of all, I think we need to find pathways to citizenship. The budget bill is an appropriate way to get around the filibuster to be able to make a judgment as to whether or not they should have a pathway. That's for the Parli- -- Parliamentarian to decide, though -- not for Joe Biden to decide.
Your first ques- -- part of the question was?
Q: It was on inflation. You mentioned unchecked inflation.
THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. There's nobody suggesting there's unchecked inflation on the way -- no serious economist. That's totally different.
I mean, look, the stock market is higher than it has been in all of history, even went down this month -- even down this month.
Now, I don't look at the stock market as a means by which to judge the economy like my predecessor did. But he'd be very -- he'd be talking to you every day for the last five months about how the stock market is so high -- higher than any time in history, still higher than any time in history.
So, that's not how I judge whether or not we have economic growth.
Q: Mr. President, on China and cyber hacking --
THE PRESIDENT: She jumps up before you do. (Laughter.)
Q: Effectively, your administration is naming and shaming China, but no sanctions. Why? And is that effective enough?
THE PRESIDENT: They're still determining exactly what happened. The investigation is not finished.
Thank you all very much.
Q: On China real quick -- on China real quick: What is your understanding of the biggest difference between what they've done versus what Russia has done in terms of cyber hacking?
THE PRESIDENT: That'd take a longer explanation.
Q: We have all the time in the world. What is it?
THE PRESIDENT: No, we don't. I have to go see the King of Jordan.
Look, to the best of my knowledge -- and I'm getting a report tomorrow morning on this, a detailed report -- my understanding is that the Chinese government, not unlike the Russian government, is not doing this themselves, but are protecting those who are doing it and maybe even accommodating them being able to do it. That may be the difference.
Thank you.
Q: Should the Olympics go forward, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT: They are.

Remarks on Child Tax Credit Relief Payments
","
THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Well, for you -- anybody under the age of 13 -- this has got to be boring, boring, boring for you. (Laughter.) Right? Well, I'll tell you what, we have to work something out here so that when this is over, your parents, your uncles, your aunts -- whoever you're with -- they owe you some ice cream or something for this. You know? (Laughter.)
Folks, it's a pleasure to be here. I'm going to take a sip here. (Drinks water.) And this -- I believe this is actually a historic day -- a historic day in the sense that we continue to build an economy that respects and recognizes the dignity of working-class families and middle-class families. It's historic and it's our effort to make another giant step toward ending child poverty in America. I think this will be one of the things that the Vice President and I will be most proud of when our terms are up.
Beginning this morning, nearly all working families -- that is people making under $150,000 as families or an individual making under $120,000 -- $125,000 who have children, are raising children in America, they're going to receive their first monthly -- first monthly tax cut payment. That payment -- that payment from the expanded Child Tax Credit that we signed into law as part of my -- our American Rescue Plan.
It's one of the largest-ever single tax cuts for families with children, and it's a reflection of our belief that the people of this country who need a tax cut aren't the folks at the top. They've got plenty of tax cuts. They're doing just fine. But it's the people in the middle, the folks who are struggling, who are just looking for a little bit of -- my dad would say, ""a little bit of breathing room."" A little bit of breathing room.
This has the potential to reduce child poverty in the same way that the Social Security reduced poverty for the elderly. And by the way, you think of monthly payments -- you get a Social Security check -- those who you know get Social Security, they get it monthly. Well, this will be -- unless you want it in one lump sum, this would be a monthly payment for childcare -- for -- excuse me, for your children, a tax cut.
And here's how the tax credit works: For every child under the age of six, a parent will get $3,600 a year. For every child 6 to 17, they'll get $3,000 per year. For example, a middle-class family with two young children would expect to receive $7,200 a year to help raise their children. This will be the -- they'll get the first half of this $3,600 starting today. Today. Today. And it'll be paid out at $600 a month between now, July, and December. And then they're going to get the rest of the payment next spring around Tax Day.
Now, if you file taxes electronically, you can go to your bank account today -- today -- and you'll see a payment that says ""Child CTC."" Let me say that again: payments of $300 for each child under the age of 6, $250 for each child between the ages of 6 and 17 on a monthly basis between now -- between July and December.
If you don't file electronic- -- your taxes electronically, as you did last year, you can expect to receive a check in the mail beginning today or a few days from now. And you'll get this payment on the 15th of every month for the rest of this year.
And if you're not required to file taxes at all in the past -- you haven't filed because you didn't owe any taxes, then you can go to: ChildTaxCredit.gov. Let me say it again: ChildTaxCredit.gov. And you will give you -- they'll give you clear information and a link to help you sign up for the first time. This can be lifechanging for so many families.
Because of the way the tax credit was structured before the American Rescue Plan, more than 26 million children from the hardest-pressed working families didn't get any full payment for the Child Credit -- for childcare -- for Child Tax Credit. Half of all Black and Hispanic children in America never received the full tax credit. We've changed all that.
In technical terms, we've made this tax cut fully refundable. In plain English, it means instead of families who need help the most getting the le- -- getting the least, the hard-working -- the hard-working families will get this on a month- -- full monthly basis.
Ninety-seven percent of the children receiving this credit come from working families. And the other 3 percent includes kids being raised by retired grandparents or by someone with a serious disability.
And by the way, this credit doesn't start to phase out until a couple is making $150,000 or a single parent is making $112,000 [$112,500]. It begins to phase out then. This is a middle-class tax cut. When I came up -- when I decided I wanted this in the legislation, I referred to it in the way it really is: It's a middle-class tax cut. It's just like the wealthy get tax cuts for a lot of things, this is a tax cut for your children -- having children.
And this can make it possible for a hardworking parent to say to his or her child, ""Honey, we get -- you can get your new braces now. We can get you a tutor to help you in that math class you're having trouble with. We can get you the sports equipment you need to sign up to -- for your first team you're going to play on.""
People have written me to tell me they'll use the money to buy their kids new shoes, to send them to summer camp, to cover afterschool care when school starts up again.
You know -- and to give you a sense of how transformative this is: This would be the largest-ever one-year decrease in child poverty in the history of the United States of America -- as we begin now. Historic reductions in child poverty among white, Black, and Latinos, and AAPI communities. It's not even close. The benefits will be felt for years.
Studies have shown -- (a baby cries) -- that tax relief that helps children -- that's okay, don't worry about it. It's okay to let him cry, or her, whichever -- that helps children and can lead to better health, better school performance, and better future earnings.
In fact, research from Columbia University in New York found that for each dollar this tax cut costs, it returns eight dollars in benefit down the line. Eight dollars would have to be spent other ways. It's a gigantic help. It's an eight to one return.
Your head, your heart, and your budget all lead to the same place. This is the right thing to do, and it's the smart thing to do.
Today, these tax cut payments are arriving automatically. But it didn't happen automatically -- the result of the work that people who did this, advocating for this for a long, long time. And we finally got it passed in my American Rescue Plan.
I want to particularly thank those who have been fighting for this for years: Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro from Connecticut. She has been a champion for this issue. Congressman Richie Neal and -- and Torres. And Senators Bennet, Brown, and Booker. And Ron Wyden.
You'll probably hear from our Republican friends -- all who voted against this -- but they'll tout the success as it helps working families in their states and their districts. But in the coming days, we're also going to hear from them saying, ""I want to now extend this tax…"" It's only for one year now.
It's all I could get it for, for the first time. And so, I want to extend it into the future now. I have another piece of legislation that will be voted on soon, saying we're going to continue this.
To the people who say we can't afford to give the middle class a break, I say: We can afford it by making people at the top and the big corporations -- over 50 of which paid no taxes last year at all -- to finally just -- just start paying their fair share. I'm not going to gouge them. Just pay their fair share. Because people who are working hard and paying taxes deserve a break.
That's why -- excuse me for all these terms I'm using, but my Build Back Better agenda, which still needs to be voted on in the Congress, keeps this tax cut for working families in place for years to come. We shouldn't let taxes go up on working families. We shouldn't let child poverty continue to stain the conscience or drag down our economy.
And so, I say to my colleagues in Congress: This tax cut for working families is something we should extend, not end, next year.
And I say to all of you watching: Make sure your family, friends, and community know about this tax cut. Send to them, as I said, ChildTaxCredit.gov to learn more about the difference this is going to make in their lives.
Let me close with this: I signed the American Rescue Plan less than two months after taking office on January 20th. Four months later, we've implemented the fir- -- we've implemented the first-ever automatic monthly payment for any major tax credit ever, as the Vice President was talking about, beyond Social Security, which was a long time ago.
This groundbreaking effort is similar to what we did in our -- what I called our ""war-time effort"" to vaccinate Americans against COVID-19, to mobilize the whole country.
We're proving -- we're proving that democracy can deliver for people, and deliver in a timely way -- saving lives, improving lives, helping fuel a recordsetting recovery, giving working families a fighting chance again.
I received an email today from a mother in Washington State. She's a young teacher who had just received her payment. She wrote, and I'm quoting, ""My family has been living hand to mouth to put me through school so I can follow my passion of molding young minds… This first CTC payment has come at the exact moment when we need it most. These payments may seem small to some, but they are lifechanging for my family, for us.""
Millions of children and their families -- starting today, their lives are about to change for the better. And our country will be better off for it as well.
This is a really good day. And parents are going to be able to tell your kids when they're 25-years-old that you were there the day this happened; we talked about it. We are showing once again that there's nothing beyond the capacity -- our capacity as Americans to get done when we do it together.
So, I want to thank you. God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. And kids, thank you for being so polite while I was speaking. You're very, very nice. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
See you all. Bye bye. (Applause.)

Remarks Prior to a Meeting with Governors and Mayors to Discuss Infrastructure and an Exchange with Reporters
","
THE PRESIDENT: Well, we're going to talk about infrastructure and how we're going to have to widen this room so you all can get in. (Laughter.)
I want to thank you for being here, all of you, to discuss an issue that has been always bipartisan for the longest time. When I got here 180 years ago, it was a bipartisan issue.
Mayors and governors more than anyone else knows what it means to be accountable to people, and you have to solve problems every single day in your communities. And -- and there's no -- there are no Democratic roads or Republican bridges.
But -- you know, but there are families in need of shorter commute times, safer commutes; kids that need to be able to drink clean drinking water that doesn't have lead in it; and communities need to have reliable transit systems.
And we have a chance to solve these problems -- a bipartisan chance to solve these problems. It would create millions of jobs, literally -- not -- not $7-an-hour jobs or even $15-an-hour jobs, but jobs of prevailing wages, making $46, $50 an hour with benefits. And, you know, a chance for America to put ourselves in a position where we can begin to win the second quarter of the 21st century, because our infrastructure, relative to the rest of the world, is moving -- we're falling behind.
I found it disturbing to find out that they ask if you name -- I think it was the 25 best airports in the world --
MR. DEESE: Yes, sir.
THE PRESIDENT: -- the United States wasn't mentioned. There wasn't a single U.S. entry.
So -- but fixing the broken today is okay, but we got to build for tomorrow. There's a lot we're going to do. And press is tired of hearing me say this because I've been talking about infrastructure for a while now. Hopefully, it won't be like the last team in here -- once a week and not get anything done.
But we're going to get something done. And that's why I think that my Build Back Better agenda is all about not just building back, but build back better than what we -- what we inherited.
And Mayors and Governors, you know how to get this done and what we have to do. It's time to stop talking about it and time to get you the resources. But what I want to talk about today is what you need most and what you think will work the best.
And so that's what we're going to be talking about and -- and hopefully, we're going to get a lot done.
So, thank you all for coming in.
Q: Do you need to do more work on the payfors, Mr. President? Are the payfors intact?
THE PRESIDENT: He's talking about -- I went up and spoke to the -- the -- Democratic caucus today, and we put together a plan that dealt with infrastructure. And it's a bipartisan plan. I think we're in good shape. There may be some slight adjustments to the -- of the payfors. And that's going to get down to what the -- what the Congress wants to do.
I've laid out how I think we'd pay for it. And we have an agreement. We have an agreement. There may be slight changes; I'm not sure what may happen, exactly how -- but it's going to be paid for. And that's what we're going to do.
So, thank you all very much.
Q: Mr. President, any concern that having two tracks here will disrupt the bipartisan agreement that was worked out?
THE PRESIDENT: No, I think it's the only way to get it done is having two tracks.
Thank you.

Remarks on Voting Rights at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
","
THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. (Applause.) I see an awful lot of good friends out there. Please have a seat if you have one.
I -- let me begin by saying I used to be important. (Laughter.) I used to be the chairman of the board of this place. And Jeffrey Rosen allowed me to do that for a while.
But thank you all for being here. I truly appreciate it. Governor, it's above and beyond the call. Mr. Mayor, I'd compli- -- I thought you were a great mayor -- still think you are -- but your judgment in fiancées is even stronger. And -- but -- but all of you. And a good friend, Bobby Brady. I see so many friends out. Al Sharpton -- Al, how are you, pal? It's great to see you. (Applause.)
And I'm -- I'm going to get in trouble here because I'm going to recognize my congresswoman from the state of Delaware, Lisa Blunt Rochester -- (applause) -- and her sister who used to run my office. Stand up. (Applause.)
Well, folks, good afternoon. There's a serious subject I'd like to talk about today. I'm here in Philadelphia at the National Constitution Center -- the city and the place where the story of ""We the People"" -- ""We the People"" began.
It's a story that's neither simple nor straightforward. That's because the story is the sum of our parts, and all those parts are fundamentally human. And being human is to be imperfect, driven by appetite and ambition as much as by goodness and grace.
But some things in America should be simple and straightforward.
Perhaps the most important of those things -- the most fundamental of those things -- is the right to vote. The right to vote freely. (Applause) The right to vote freely, the right -- the right to vote fairly, the right to have your vote counted. The democratic threshold is liberty. With it, anything is possible. Without it, nothing -- nothing.
And for our democracy and the work -- and to deliver our work and [for] our people, it's up to all of us to protect that right. This is a test of our time and what I'm here to talk about today.
Just think about the past election.
A 102-year-old woman in Arkansas who voted for the first time on the very spot she once picked cotton.
A 94-year-old woman in Michigan who voted early and in person in her seventy-se- -- 72nd consecutive election. You know what she said? She said this election was, quote, ""the most important vote that we ever had.""
The daughter who voted in the memory of her dad who died of COVID-19 so others wouldn't have the experience of pain and darkness and loss that she was going through. Patients out there.
And the parents -- the parents who voted for school their children will learn in.
Sons and daughters voted for the planet they're going to live on.
Young people just turning 18 and everyone who, for the first time in their lives, thought they could truly make a difference.
America -- America and Americans of every background voted. They voted for good jobs and higher wages. They voted for racial equity and justice. They voted to make healthcare a right, not a privilege.
And the reason that Americans went to vote and the lengths they went to vote -- to be able to vote in this past election were absolutely extraordinary. In fact, the fact that so many election officials across the country made it easier and safer for them to be able to vote in the middle of a pandemic was remarkable.
As a result, in 2020, more people voted in America than ever -- ever in the history of America, in the middle of a once-in-a-century pandemic. (Applause.)
All told, more than 150 [million] Americans of every age, of every race, of every background exercised their right to vote.
They voted early. They voted absentee. They voted in person. They voted by mail. They voted by drop box. And then they got their families and friends to go out and vote.
Election officials, the entire electoral system, withstood unrelenting political attacks, physical threats, intimidation, and pressure. They did so with unyielding courage and
faith in our democracy.
With recount after recount after recount, court case after court case, the 2020 election was the most scrutinized election ever in American history. Challenge after challenge brought to local, state, and election officials; state legislatures; state and federal courts -- even to the United States Supreme Court not once, but twice.
More than 80 judges, including those appointed by my predecessor, heard the arguments. In every case, neither cause nor evidence was found to undermine the national achievement of administering this historic election in the face of such extraordinary challenges.
Audits, recounts were conducted in Arizona, in Wisconsin. In Georgia, it was recounted three times.
It's clear. For those who challenge the results and question the integrity of the election: No other election has ever been held under such scrutiny and such high standards.
The Big Lie is just that: a big lie. (Applause.)
The 2020 election -- it's not hyperbole to suggest -- the most examined and the fullest expression of the will of the people in the history of this nation. This should be celebrated -- the example of America at its best. But instead, we continue to see an example of human nature at its worst -- something darker and more sinister.
In America, if you lose, you accept the results. You follow the Constitution. You try again. You don't call facts ""fake"" and then try to bring down the American experiment just because you're unhappy. That's not statesmanship. (Applause.)
That's not statesmanship; that's selfishness. That's not democracy; it's the denial of the right to vote. It suppresses. It subjugates.
The denial of full and free and fair elections is the most un-American thing that any of us can imagine, the most undemocratic, the most unpatriotic, and yet, sadly, not unprecedented.
From denying enslaved people fu- -- full citizenship until the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments after the Civil War; to denying women the right to vote until the 19th Amendment 100 years ago; to poll taxes and literacy tests, and the Ku Klux Klan campaigns of violence and terror that lasted into the '50s and '60s; to the Supreme Court decision in 2013 and then again just two weeks ago –- a decision that weakened the landmark Voting Rights Act; to the willful attacks -- election attacks in 2020; and then to a whole other level of threat -- the violence and the deadly insurrection on the Capitol on January 6th.
I just got back from Europe, speaking to the G7 and to NATO. They wonder -- not a joke -- they wonder, Gov -- they ask me, ""Is it going to be okay?"" The citadel of democracy in the world, ""Is it o- -- going to be okay?""
Time and again, we've weathered threats to the right to vote in free and fair elections. And each time, we found a way to overcome. And that's what we must do today.
Vice President Harris and I have spent our careers doing this work. And I've asked her to lead, to bring people together to protect the right to vote and our democracy. And it starts with continuing the fight to pass H.R.1, the For the People Act. (Applause.)
That bill -- that bill would help end voter suppression in the states, get dark money out of politics, give voice to the people at the grassroots level, create a fairer district maps, and end partisan political gerrymandering.
Last month, Republicans opposed even debating, even considering For the People Act. Senate Democrats stood united to protect our democracy and the sanctity of the vote. We must pass the For the People Act. It's a national imperative.
We must also fight for the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to restore and expand -- (applause) -- to restore and expand voting protections and prevent voter suppression. All the congresswomen and men here -- there's a bunch of you -- you knew John, many of you.
Just weeks ago, the Supreme Court yet again weakened the Voting Rights Act and upheld what Justice Kagan called, quote, ""a significant race-based disparity in voting opportunities.""
The Court's decision, as harmful as is, does not limit the -- Congress' ability to repair the damage done. That's the important point. It puts the burden back on Congress to restore the Voting Rights Act to its intended strength.
As soon as Congress passes the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, I will sign it and let the whole world see it. (Applause.) That will be an important moment.
And the world is wondering -- the world is wondering -- and Dwight knows what I'm talking about, for real. You know, the world is wondering, ""What is America going to do?""
But we also have to clear-eyed about the obstruction we face. Legislation is one tool, but not the only tool. And it's not the only measure of our obligation to defend democracy today.
For example, Attorney General Merrick Garland announced that the United States Department of Justice is going to be using its authorities to challenge the onslaught of state laws undermining voting rights in old and new ways. (Applause.)
The focus -- the focus will be on dismantling racially discriminatory laws, like the recent challenge to Georgia's vicious anti-voting law.
The Department of Justice will do so with a voting rights division that -- at my request -- is doubling its size in enforcement staff. (Applause)
Civil rights groups -- civil rights groups and other organizations have announced their plans to stay vigilant and challenge these odious laws in the courts.
In Texas, for example, Republican-led state legislature wants to allow partisan poll watchers to intimidate voters and imperil impartial poll workers. They want voters to dive [drive] farther and be able to be in a position where they wonder who's watching them and intimidating them; to wait longer to vote. To drive a hell of lot lo- -- excuse me -- a long way -- (laughter) -- to get to vote. They want to make it so hard and inconvenient that they hope people don't vote at all. That's what this is about.
This year alone, 17 states have enacted -- not just proposed, but enacted -- 28 new laws to make it harder for Americans to vote, not to mention -- and catch this -- nearly 400 additional bills Republican members of the state legislatures are trying to pass.
The 21st century Jim Crow assault is real. It's unrelenting, and we're going to challenge it vigorously.
While -- (applause) -- while this broad assault against voting rights is not unprecedented, it's taking on a new and, literally, pernicious forms.
It's no longer just about who gets to vote or making it easier for eligible voters to vote. It's about who gets to count the vote -- who gets to count whether or not your vote counted at all. It's about moving from independent election administrators who work for the people to polarized state legislatures and partisan actors who work for political parties.
To me, this is simple: This is election subversion. It's the most dangerous threat to voting and the integrity of free and fair elections in our history. Never before have they decided who gets to count -- count -- what votes count.
Some -- some legi- -- state legislatures want to make it harder for you to vote. And if you vote, they want to be able to tell you your vote doesn't count for any reason they make up.
They want the ability to reject the final count and ignore the will of the people if their preferred candidate loses.
And they're trying -- not only targeting people of color, they're targeting voters of all races and backgrounds. It's with a simple target: who did not vote for them. That's the target.
It's unconscionable. I mean, really, I -- it's hard to -- it's hard to declare just how critical this is. It's simply unconscionable.
We've got to shore up our election system and address the threats of election subversion, not just from abroad -- which I spent time with Putin talking about -- but from home. From home.
We must ask those who represent us at the federal, state, and local levels: Will you deny the will of the people? Will you ignore their voices?
We have to ask: Are you on the side of truth or lies; fact or fiction; justice or injustice; democracy or autocracy? That's what it's coming down to.
Which brings me to perhaps the most important thing we have to do: We have to for- -- forge a coalition of Americans of every background and political party -- the advocates, the students, the faith leaders, the labor leaders, the business executives -- and raise the urgency of this moment.
Because as much as people know they're screwing around with the election process, I don't think that most people think this is about who gets to count what vote counts -- literally, not figuratively. You vote for certain electors to vote for somebody for President. State legislator comes along -- under their proposal -- and they say, ""No, we don't like those electors. We're going to appoint other electors who are going to vote for the other guy or other woman.""
Because here's the deal: In 2020, democracy was put to a test -- first by the pandemic; then by a desperate attempt to deny the reality and the results of the election; and then by a violent and deadly insurrection on the Capitol, the citadel of our democracy.
I've been around a long time in public life. I thought I've seen it all or most of it all. But I never thought I'd see that, for real.
And in spite of what you see on television -- and you saw it -- you have senators saying it was just a day at the Capitol, just people visiting the Capitol.
Folks -- but we met the test. Because of the extraordinary courage of election officials -- many of them Republicans; our court system; and those brave Capitol police officers -- because of them, democracy held.
Look how close it came. I mean, for real, how close it came. We're going to face another test in 2022: a new wave of unprecedented voter suppression, and raw and sustained election subversion. We have to prepare now.
As I've said time and again: No matter what, you can never stop the American people from voting. They will decide, and the power must always be with the people.
That's why, just like we did in 2020, we have to prepare for 2022. We'll engage in an all-out effort to educate voters about the changing laws, register them to vote, and then get the vote out.
We'll encourage people to run for office themselves at every level.
We will be asking my Republican friends -- in Congress, in states, in cities, in counties -- to stand up, for God's sake, and help prevent this concerted effort to undermine our elections and the sacred right to vote. (Applause.) Have you no shame? (Applause.)
Whether it's stopping foreign interference in our elections or the spread of disinformation from within, we have to work together.
Vice President Harris and I will be making it clear that there's real peril in making raw power, rather than the idea of liberty, the centerpiece of the common life.
The Founders understood this. The women of Seneca Falls understood this. The brave, heroic foot soldiers of the Civil Rights Movement understood this. So must we.
This isn't about Democrats and Republicans; it's literally about who we are as Americans. It's that basic. It's about the kind of country we want today, the kind of country we want for our children and grandchildren tomorrow. And quite frankly, the whole world is watching. Folks -- (applause).
I'm not being sentimental. I'm not preaching to you. I'm just giving it to you straight, as I promised I would always do -- lay things out on the line and honor your trust with trust [truth].
So hear me clearly: There is an unfolding assault taking place in America today -- an attempt to suppress and subvert the right to vote in fair and free elections, an assault on democracy, an assault on liberty, an assault on who we are -- who we are as Americans.
For, make no mistake, bullies and merchants of fear and peddlers of lies are threatening the very foundation of our country.
It gives me no pleasure to say this. I never thought in my entire career I'd ever have to say it. But I swore an oath to you, to God -- to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution. And that's an oath that forms a sacred trust to defend America against all threats both foreign and domestic. (Applause.)
The assault on free and fair elections is just such a threat, literally. I've said it before: We're are facing the most significant test of our democracy since the Civil War. That's not hyperbole. Since the Civil War. The Confederates back then never breached the Capitol as insurrectionists did on January the 6th.
I'm not saying this to alarm you; I'm saying this because you should be alarmed.
I'm also saying this: There's good news. It doesn't have to be this way. It doesn't have to be, for real. We have the means. We just need to show the will -- the will to save and strengthen our democracy.
We did it in 20- -- we did it in the 2020. The battle for the soul of America -- in that battle, the people voted. Democracy prevailed. Our Constitution held. We have to do it again.
My fellow Americans, it requires fair-mindedness; devotion to justice; corny as it sounds, a love of country. It requires us to unite in common purpose, to declare here and now: We, the people, will never give up. (Applause.) We will not give in. We will overcome. We will do it together. And guaranteeing the right to vote, ensuring every vote is counted has always been the most patriotic thing we can do. (Applause.)
Just remember, our late friend John Lewis said, ""Freedom is not a state; it is an act."" ""Freedom is not a state; it is an act."" And we must act, and we will act. For our cause is just, our vision is clear, and our hearts are full. (Applause.)
For ""We the People,"" for our democracy, for America itself, we must act. (Applause.)
God bless you all. And may God protect our troops and all those stand watch over our democracy. (Applause.) But act. We've got to act. Thank you. (Applause.)

Remarks on Efforts to Reduce Gun Crimes and an Exchange with Reporters
","
THE PRESIDENT: Folks, I want to start by recognizing the remarkable protests that are taking place in Cuba, with the Cuban people demanding their freedom from an authoritarian regime. And I don't think we've seen anything like this protest in a long, long time -- if, quite frankly, ever.
The United States stands firmly with the people of Cuba as they assert their universal rights. And we call on the government -- the government of Cuba to refrain from violence or attempts to silence the voice of the people of Cuba.
And we're also closely following the developments in Haiti in the wake of the horrific assassination of the President that recently took place. The people of Haiti deserve peace and security, and Haiti's political leaders need to come together for the good of their country.
Over the weekend, I dispatched a high-level, expert delegation to assess the situation and to determine where the United States can offer our support.
And finally, as a close neighbor and friend of the people of both Cuba and Haiti, the United States stands ready to continue to provide assistance, and I'll have more for you as we move on.
But the purpose of the meeting today is we've convened a group of law enforcement and other community leaders, including mayors of the -- of our cities, one, to thank them for their service because we owe them big time; second, to hear directly from each of them about reducing violent crime and, particularly, gun violence in our communities.
Last month, I met with a similar group to unveil my comprehensive strategy to do just that. And it's been -- it's been an -- you know, I guess -- I look at the Attorney General -- we've been this a lo- -- at this a long time. A long time. It seems like most of my career I've been dealing with this issue.
While there's no ""one-size-fit-all"" approach, we know there are some things that work, and the first of those that work is stemming the flow of firearms used to commit violent crimes. And we've talked -- you and I have talked about this, Mayor, before.
MAYOR BOWSER: Mm-hmm. Absolutely.
THE PRESIDENT: And it includes cracking down on holding rogue gun dealers accountable for violating the federal law. It includes the Justice Department creating five new strike forces to crack down on illegal gun trafficking (inaudible) supplying weapons to cities of New York -- from New York to the Bay Area.
Secondly, it's supporting local law enforcement with the federal support they need. Our strategy provides including funding for law enforcement through the American Rescue Plan for states, cities, and to be able to hire police and pay them overtime in order to advance community policing.
Third, our plan invests in community violence and intervention. We -- what we want to do is when we -- we know we utilize trusted community members and encourage more community policing, we can intervene before the violence erupts -- at least that's what, I think, consensus and our experience. And community violence intervention programs have shown to reduce crime in some cities by up to 60 percent.
Fourthly, our strategy to fund the other vital services, like mental health and substance abuse disorder programs, job training, and summer job programs. And this is going to help prevent crime and support young people to pick up a paycheck instead of a pistol.
And fifth, our strategy helps formerly incarcerated people successfully reenter society with housing, jobs, and training, and other support that, up to now, have been denied to them. Somebody gets -- gets out of jail right now, after serving their time, they get a bus ticket and 25 bucks, and they end up under the same bridge they left. And we know this will help.
This will make us all safer. The American Rescue Plan funds programs to help get job training, apprenticeships, and work experience so they can gain stability and security and a chance for a better life.
There's a lot more to my strategy, but at -- that's at the core. It's about coordinating at a federal, state, and local level. That's what, ultimately, we're going to talk about today.
We recognize that we have to come together to fulfill the first responsibility of a democracy and to keep each other safe. And that's what the American people are looking for when it comes to reducing violent crime and gun violence.
And I think this group is illustrative of -- of what we need to get put together, and I want to thank them for being here. And I'm going to look forward to hearing from them because I'm going to be asking them what they think we should be doing on the federal level.
So, thank you very much. And we'll have more to say as we move on. Thank you.
Q: Mr. President, would you consider changing the embargo on Cuba? Would you consider making any changes to the embargo with Cuba?
Q: When you will be ready to change Trump's reversal on Cuba, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT: We are going to have more to say about Cuba and Haiti as the week goes on and -- so stay tuned. Thank you.

Remarks on Signing an Executive Order Promoting Competition in The American Economy and an Exchange with Reporters
","
THE PRESIDENT: Hello, everyone. They have a Cabinet meeting. (Laughter.) Please -- please be seated. Thank you.
Well, it is not ""good morning,"" which my remarks say here, but -- (laughter) -- good afternoon. We're in the midst of a historic economic recovery. And because our successful vaccination program strategy has been working and the immediate relief through the American Rescue Plan has brought back our economy from the worst economic crisis in nearly a century, America is now on track. We're now on track for the highest economic growth in 40 years and among the highest growth records on record.
We designed our ecomi- -- our economic strategy to be durable through the ups and downs that come with recovery. And there are ups and downs.
That's why the American Rescue Plan was designed to help people not just all at once, but over the course of a full year so we could continue supporting families, small businesses, state and local budgets to help them weather those ups and downs.
And now that the economy is back on track, we're making progress on the second phase of our strategy: ensuring long-term growth.
That's what my Build Back Better agenda, including my Americans Family Plan and the bipartisan infrastructure agreement we reached last month -- that's what they're all about: long term.
But to keep our country moving, we have to take another step as well -- and I know you're all tired of hearing me during the campaign and since I'm elected President talk about it -- and that's bringing fair competition back to the economy.
That's why today I'm going to be signing shortly an executive order promoting competition to lower price -- to lower prices, to increase wages, and to take another critical step toward an economy that works for everybody.
The heart of American capitalism is a simple idea: open and fair competition -- that means that if your companies want to win your business, they have to go out and they have to up their game; better prices and services; new ideas and products.
That competition keeps the economy moving and keeps it growing. Fair competition is why capitalism has been the world's greatest force for prosperity and growth.
By the same token, ""competitive economy"" means companies must do all they do to do -- everything they do to compete for workers: offering higher wages, more flexible hours, better benefits.
But what we've seen over the past few decades is less competition and more concentration that holds our economy back. We see it in big agriculture, in big tech, in big pharma. The list goes on.
Rather than competing for consumers, they are consuming their competitors. Rather than competing for workers, they're finding ways to gain the upper hand on labor. And too often, the government has actually made it harder for new companies to break in and compete.
Look at what that means for family budgets. Take prescription drugs: Just a handful of companies control the market for many vital medicines, giving them leverage over everyone else to charge whatever they want. As a result, Americans pay two and a half times more for prescription drugs than in any other leading country. And nearly one in four Americans struggles to afford their medication.
Another example: hearing aids. Right now, if you need a hearing aid, you can't just walk into a pharmacy and pick one up over the counter. You have to get it from a doctor or a specialist. Not only does that make getting hearing aids inconvenient, it makes them considerably more expensive, and it makes it harder for new companies to compete, innovate, and sell hearing aids at lower prices.
As a result, a pair -- a pair of hea- -- a pair of hearing aids can cost thousands of dollars. That's a big reason why just one in seven Americans with hearing loss actually use a hearing aid.
Another example: Internet services. There are more than 65 million Americans who live in a place with only one high-speed Internet provider. Research shows, when you have unlimited Internet operation, you pay up to five times more on average than families in places with more choices. That's what a lack of competition does: it raises the prices you pay.
And it's not just consumers getting hurt. Big ag is putting a squeeze on farmers. Small and family farms, first-time farmers -- like veterans coming home and Black and Latino and Indigenous farmers -- they're seeing price hikes for seed, lopsided contracts, shrinking profits, and growing debt.
Lack of competition hurts workers as well. In many communities, there are only a handful of employers left competing for workers. Think of company towns across Appalachia and other parts of the country where one big corporation runs the show.
When corporations have that kind of leverage over workers, it pushes down aver- -- it pushes down advertised wages by up to 17 percent. And as competition decreases, businesses don't feel the pressure to innovate or invest in their workforce. That hurts working families and it hurts our economy.
All told, between rising prices and lowering wages, lack of competition costs the median American household $5,000 a year.
Now, look, I'm a proud capitalist. I spent most of my career representing the corporate state of Delaware. I know America can't succeed unless American business succeeds.
But let me be very clear: Capitalism without competition isn't capitalism; it's exploitation. Without healthy competition, big players can change and charge whatever they want and treat you however they want. And for too many Americans, that means accepting a bad deal for things that can't go -- you can't go without.
So, we know we've got a problem -- a major problem. But we also have an incredible opportunity. We can bring back more competition to more of the country, helping entrepreneurs and small businesses get in the game, helping workers get a better deal, helping families save money every month. The good news is: We've done it before.
In the early 1900s, President Teddy Roosevelt saw an economy dominated by giants like Standard Oil and JP Morgan's railroads. He took them on, and he won. And he gave the little guy a fighting chance.
Decades later, during the Great Depression, his cousin Franklin Roosevelt saw a wave of corporate mergers that wiped out sec- -- scores of small businesses, crushing competition and innovation. So he ramped up antitrust enforcement eightfold in just two years, saving families billions in today's dollars and helping to set the course for sustained economic growth after World War Two.
He also called for an economic bill of rights, including, quote, ""the right of every businessman, large and small, to trade in an atmosphere of freedom from unfair competition and domination by monopolies."" End of quote.
Between them, the two Roosevelts established an American tradition -- an antitrust tradition. It is how we ensure that our economy isn't about people working for capitalism; it's about capitalism working for people.
But, over time, we've lost the fundamental American idea that true capitalism depends on fair and open competition. Forty years ago, we chose the wrong path, in my view, following the misguided philosophy of people like Robert Bork, and pulled back on enforcing laws to promote competition.
We're now 40 years into the experiment of letting giant corporations accumulate more and more power. And where- -- what have we gotten from it? Less growth, weakened investment, fewer small businesses. Too many Americans who feel left behind. Too many people who are poorer than their parents.
I believe the experiment failed. We have to get back to an economy that grows from the bottom up and the middle out.
The executive order I'm soon going to be signing commits the federal government to full and aggressive enforcement of our antitrust laws. No more tolerance for abusive actions by monopolies. No more bad mergers that lead to mass layoffs, higher prices, fewer options for workers and consumers alike.
My executive order includes 72 specific actions. I expect the federal agencies -- and they know this -- to help restore competition so that we have lower prices, higher wages, more money, more options, and more convenience for the American people.
Today, I want to focus on three specific actions:
First, the FDA -- the Food and Drug Administration -- are going to work with states and Tribes to safely import prescription drugs from Canada. That's just one of many actions in the executive order that will lower prescription drug prices.
Second, the FDA is going to issue rules so that hearing aids can be sold over the counter. That's something the last administration was supposed to have done but didn't do. We're going to get it done. After these rules go into effect, a pair of hearing aids can cost hundreds of dollars, not thousands. And you'll be able to pick them up at your local drugstore.
Third, we're going to improve competition for workers. I've talked a lot about non-compete agreements -- contracts that say you can't take another job in your field, even if you get a better deal. I made a speech -- I was just reminiscing with my staff -- back in 2018, at the Brookings Institution, where I talked about the non-compete clauses that were just -- I found -- to be absolutely ridiculous, but how prevalent they were throughout industries.
At least one in three businesses require their workers to sign a non-compete agreement. These aren't just high-paid executives or scientists who hold secret formulas for Coca-Cola so Pepsi can't get their hands on it. A recent study found one in five workers without a college education is subject to non-compete agreements. They're construction workers, hotel workers, disproportionately women and women of color.
Think of the 26-year-old employee at a company. She's a star worker, but she isn't being treated right. She's underpaid, passed over for promotions. A competitor across the street knows and wants to bring her in at a higher wage, but she can't do it. Her company threatens legal action over a non-compete clause she had to sign in order to get hired in the first place. She can't afford a lawyer for help, so she's locked in.
Imagine if you're in her shoes. You'd feel powerless, disrespected, bullied, trapped. That's not right. Workers should be free to take a better job if someone offers it.
If your employer wants to keep you, he or she should have to make it worth your while to stay. That's the kind of competition that leads to better wages and greater dignity of work.
Look, I'm not going to go into it now, but I used to talk about, you know, there's non-compete clauses of people running the machines that lay down asphalt. If, in fact, you get offered a job and you have a -- you know, you're in Arkansas doing it, a lot of -- a specific example is you can't take a job in west Texas to do it. What in the hell does that have to do with anything? (Laughter.) No, I'm serious. Or there were clauses in McDonald's contracts: You can't leave Burger King to go to McDonald's. Come on. Is there a trade secret about what's inside that patty? (Laughter.) No, but I'm serious.
You all -- I don't know if you do know; I didn't know it until five years ago -- the incredible number of non-compete clauses for ordinary people who -- it was done for one reason: to keep wages low. Period.
Look, my executive order calls on the FTC to ban or limit non-compete agreements. Let workers chose who they want to work for.
I'm also calling on the FTC to do away with certain occupational licensing requirements. You realize, if you want to braid hair and you move from one state to another, sometimes you have to do a six-month apprenticeship, even though you've been in the business for a long, long time? What the hell -- what's that all about?
Military families, for example, they're often on the move between states with each new assignment. So you have a woman in the military, her husband is following her, or vice versa. Guess what? If you have -- if you're a plumber, you have to get a different license when you move from Delaware to Missouri.
Look, it can't be a significant burden to get a new license in a new home state. That burden can't be around anymore. It takes time and it takes money. It takes a toll on a family's income while you're waiting. We should remove that barrier, providing more mobility, more opportunity, higher wages for families on the move.
This is something that my wife, Jill, has worked on together with Michelle Obama through the Joining Forces initiative for the military.
We're going to keep that moving. We're going to get it done in an executive order.
Let me close with this: Competition works. We know it works. We've seen it works when it exists. Fair competition is was what made America the wealthiest, most innovative nation in history. That's why people come here to invent things and start new businesses.
In the competition against China and other nations of the 21st century, let's show that American democracy and the American people can truly outcompete anyone. Because I know that just given half a chance, the American people will never, ever, ever let their country down. Imagine if we give everyone a full and fair chance. That's what this is all about. That's what I'm about to do.
So I'd like to invite the Cabinet members up here. I'd like to -- and the Attorney General is here -- Attorney General Garland. Xavier -- Mr. Secretary, you can come up too. I've been watching on television; you've been really good. (Laughter.) Gina Raimondo. Also, Pete Buttigieg. And the chair of the FCC [FTC], Lian [sic] -- excuse me, Lina Khan, Acting Chair of the FTC. And Director of the National Economic Council.
Am I leaving anybody out? Anyway, come on up. This may be the first Cabinet meeting we've had.
Okay. ""Promoting Competition in the American Economy.""
First pen. (Laughter.) Second pen. Third. Fourth. (Laughter.) Fifth.
I'm wondering how Barack did this with a shorter name. (Laughter.)
(The executive order is signed.)
Thank you. Thank you, everyone. (Applause.)
Q: Mr. President, how did President Putin respond to your call today, sir?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, I made it very clear to him that -- that the United States expects, when a ransomware operation is coming from his soil, even though it's not -- not sponsored by the state, we expect them to act if we give them enough information to act on who that is.
And, secondly, that we have set up a means of communications now, on a regular basis, to be able to communicate to one another when each of us thinks something is happening in another country that affects the home country.
And so, it went well. I'm optimistic.
Q: You said, three weeks ago, there would be consequences. Will there be, sir?
THE PRESIDENT: Yes.

Remarks on the Drawdown of U.S. Forces in Afghanistan and an Exchange with Reporters
","
THE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon. Earlier today, I was briefed by our senior military and national security leaders on the status of the drawdown of U.S. forces and allied forces in Afghanistan.
When I announced our drawdown in April, I said we would be out by September, and we're on track to meet that target.
Our military mission in Afghanistan will conclude on August 31st. The drawdown is proceeding in a secure and orderly way, prioritizing the safety of our troops as they depart.
Our military commanders advised me that once I made the decision to end the war, we needed to move swiftly to conduct the main elements of the drawdown. And in this context, speed is safety.
And thanks to the way in which we have managed our withdrawal, no one -- no one U.S. forces or any forces have -- have been lost. Conducting our drawdown differently would have certainly come with a increased risk of safety to our personnel.
To me, those risks were unacceptable. And there was never any doubt that our military would perform this task efficiently and with the highest level of professionalism. That's what they do. And the same is true of our NATO Allies and partners who have supported -- we are supporting, and supporting us as well, as they conclude their retrograde.
I want to be clear: The U.S. military mission in Afghanistan continues through the end of August. We remain -- we retain personnel and capacities in the country, and we maintain some authority -- excuse me, the same authority under which we've been operating for some time.
As I said in April, the United States did what we went to do in Afghanistan: to get the terrorists who attacked us on 9/11 and to deliver justice to Osama Bin Laden, and to degrade the terrorist threat to keep Afghanistan from becoming a base from which attacks could be continued against the United States. We achieved those objectives. That's why we went.
We did not go to Afghanistan to nation-build. And it's the right and the responsibility of the Afghan people alone to decide their future and how they want to run their country.
Together, with our NATO Allies and partners, we have trained and equipped over three hu- -- nearly 300,000 current serving members of the military -- of the Afghan National Security Force, and many beyond that who are no longer serving. Add to that, hundreds of thousands more Afghan National Defense and Security Forces trained over the last two decades.
We provided our Afghan partners with all the tools -- let me emphasize: all the tools, training, and equipment of any modern military. We provided advanced weaponry. And we're going to continue to provide funding and equipment. And we'll ensure they have the capacity to maintain their air force.
But most critically, as I stressed in my meeting just two weeks ago with President Ghani and Chairman Abdullah, Afghan leaders have to come together and drive toward a future that the Afghan people want and they deserve.
In our meeting, I also assured Ghani that U.S. support for the people of Afghanistan will endure. We will continue to provide civilian and humanitarian assistance, including speaking out for the rights of women and girls.
I intend to maintain our diplomatic presedence [presence] in Afghanistan, and we are coordinating closely with our international partners in order to continue to secure the international airport.
And we're going to engage in a determined diplomacy to pursue peace and a peace agreement that will end this senseless violence.
I've asked Secretary of State Blinken and our Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation to work vigorously with the parties in Afghanistan, as well as the regional and international stakeholders to support a negotiated solution.
To be clear -- to be clear: Countries in the region have an essential role to play in supporting a peaceful settlement. We'll work with them, and they should help step up their efforts as well.
We're going to continue to work for the release of detained Americans, including Mark -- excuse me -- Fre-- Frerichs -- I want to pronounce the name correctly; I mis- -- I misspoke -- so that he can return to his family safely.
We're also going to continue to make sure that we take on the Afghan nationals who work side-by-side with U.S. forces, including interpreters and translators -- since we're no longer going to have military there after this; we're not going to need them and they have no jobs -- who are also going to be vital to our efforts so they -- and they've been very vital -- and so their families are not exposed to danger as well.
We've already dramatically accelerated the procedure time for Special Immigrant Visas to bring them to the United States.
Since I was inaugurated on January 20th, we've already approved 2,500 Special Immigrant Visas to come to the United States. Up to now, fewer than half have exercised their right to do that. Half have gotten on aircraft and com -- commercial flights and come, and the other half believe they want to stay -- at least thus far.
We're working closely with Congress to change the authorization legislation so that we can streamline the process of approving those visas. And those who have stood up for the operation to physically relocate thousands of Afghans and their families before the U.S. military mission concludes so that, if they choose, they can wait safely outside of Afghanistan while their U.S. visas are being processed.
The operation has identified U.S. facilities outside of the continental United States, as well as in third countries, to host our Afghan allies, if they ch- -- if they so choose. And, starting this month, we're going to begin to re- -- re- -- reloc- -- we're going to begin relocation flights for Afghanistan SIV applicants and their families who choose to leave.
We have a point person in the White House and at the State Department-led task force coordinating all these efforts.
But our message to those women and men is clear: There is a home for you in the United States if you so choose, and we will stand with you just as you stood with us.
When I made the decision to end the U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan, I judged that it was not in the national interest of the United States of America to continue fighting this war indefinitely. I made the decision with clear eyes, and I am briefed daily on the battlefield updates.
But for those who have argued that we should stay just six more months or just one more year, I ask them to consider the lessons of recent history.
In 2011, the NATO Allies and partners agreed that we would end our combat mission in 2014. In 2014, some argued, ""One more year."" So we kept fighting, and we kept taking casualties. In 2015, the same. And on and on.
Nearly 20 years of experience has shown us that the current security situation only confirms that ""just one more year"" of fighting in Afghanistan is not a solution but a recipe for being there indefinitely.
It's up to Afghans to make the decision about the future of their country.
Others are more direct. Their argument is that we should stay with the Afghan -- in Afghanistan indefinitely. In doing so, they point to the fact that we -- we have not taken losses in this last year, so they claim that the cost of just maintaining the status quo is minimal.
But that ignores the reality and the facts that already presented on the ground in Afghanistan when I took office: The Taliban was at its strongest mil- -- is at its strongest militarily since 2001.
The number of U.S. forces in Afghanistan had been reduced to a bare minimum. And the United States, in the last administration, made an agreement that the -- with the Taliban to remove all our forces by May 1 of this past -- of this year. That's what I inherited. That agreement was the reason the Taliban had ceased major attacks against U.S. forces.
If, in April, I had instead announced that the United States was going to back -- going back on that agreement made by the last administration -- [that] the United States and allied forces would remain in Afghanistan for the foreseeable future -- the Taliban would have again begun to target our forces.
The status quo was not an option. Staying would have meant
U.S. troops taking casualties; American men and women back in the middle of a civil war. And we would have run the risk of having to send more troops back into Afghanistan to defend our remaining troops.
Once that agreement with the Taliban had been made, staying with a bare minimum force was no longer possible.
So let me ask those who wanted us to stay: How many more -- how many thousands more of America's daughters and sons are you willing to risk? How long would you have them stay?
Already we have members of our military whose parents fought in Afghanistan 20 years ago. Would you send their children and their grandchildren as well? Would you send your own son or daughter?
After 20 years -- a trillion dollars spent training and equipping hundreds of thousands of Afghan National Security and Defense Forces, 2,448 Americans killed, 20,722 more wounded, and untold thousands coming home with unseen trauma to their mental health -- I will not send another generation of Americans to war in Afghanistan with no reasonable expectation of achieving a different outcome.
The United States cannot afford to remain tethered to policies creating a response to a world as it was 20 years ago. We need to meet the threats where they are today.
Today, the terrorist threat has metastasized beyond Afghanistan. So, we are repositioning our resources and adapting our counterterrorism posture to meet the threats where they are now significantly higher: in South Asia, the Middle East, and Africa.
But make no mistake: Our military and intelligence leaders are confident they have the capabilities to protect the homeland and our interests from any resurgent terrorist challenge emerging or emanating from Afghanistan.
We are developing a counterterrorism over-the-horizon capability that will allow us to keep our eyes firmly fixed on any direct threats to the United States in the region, and act quickly and decisively if needed.
And we also need to focus on shoring up America's core strengths to meet the strategic competition with China and other nations that is really going to determine -- determine our future.
We have to defeat COVID-19 at home and around the world, make sure we're better prepared for the next pandemic or biological threat.
We need to establish international norms for cyberspace and the use of emergenc- -- emerging technologies.
We need to take concerted action to fight existential threats of climate change.
And we will be more formidable to our adversaries and competitors over the long run if we fight the battles of the next 20 years, not the last 20 years.
Finally, I want to recognize the incredible sacrifice and dedication that the U.S. military and civilian personnel, serving alongside our Allies and partners, have made over the last two decades in Afghanistan.
I want to honor the significance of what they've accomplished and the great personal risk they encountered and the incredible cost to their families: pursuing the terrorist threat in some of the most unforgiving terrain on the planet -- and I've been almost throughout that entire country; ensuring there hasn't been another attack on the homeland from Afghanistan for the last 20 years; taking out Bin Laden.
I want to thank you all for your service and the dedication to the mission so many of you have given, and to the sacrifices that you and your families have made over the long course of this war.
We'll never forget those who gave the last full measure of devotion for their country in Afghanistan, nor those whose lives have been immeasurably altered by wounds sustained in service to their country.
We're ending America's longest war, but we'll always, always honor the bravery of the American patriots who served in it.
May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you.
Q: Mr. President -- do you trust the Taliban, Mr. President?
Q: Is a Taliban takeover of Afghanistan now inevitable?
THE PRESIDENT: No, it is not.
Q: Why?
THE PRESIDENT: Because you -- the Afghan troops have 300,000 well-equipped -- as well-equipped as any army in the world -- and an air force against something like 75,000 Taliban. It is not inevitable.
Q: Do you trust the Taliban, Mr. President? Do you trust the Taliban, sir?
THE PRESIDENT: You -- is that a serious question?
Q: It is absolutely a serious question. Do you trust the Taliban?
THE PRESIDENT: No, I do not.
Q: Do you trust handing over the country to the Taliban?
THE PRESIDENT: No, I do not trust the Taliban.
Q: So why are you handing the country over?
Q: Mr. President, is the U.S. responsible for the deaths of Afghans after you leave the country?
Q: Mr. President, will you amplify that question, please? Will you amplify your answer, please -- why you don't trust the Taliban?
THE PRESIDENT: It's a -- it's a silly question. Do I trust the Taliban? No. But I trust the capacity of the Afghan military, who is better trained, better equipped, and more re- -- more competent in terms of conducting war.
Yes, ma'am.
Q: Thank you, Mr. President. Given the amount of money that has been spent and the number of lives that have been lost, in your view, with making this decision, were the last 20 years worth it?
THE PRESIDENT: You know my record. I can tell by the way you asked the question.
I opposed permanently having American forces in Afghanistan. I argued, from the beginning, as you may recall -- it came to light after the administration was over, last -- our administration -- no nation has ever unified Afghanistan. No nation. Empires have gone there and not done it.
The focus we had -- and I strongly support it -- and you may remember I physically went to Afghanistan. I was up in that pass where Osama bin Laden was -- allegedly escaped or -- out of harm's way.
We went for two reasons: one, to bring Osama bin Laden to the gates of hell, as I said at the time. The second reason was to eliminate al Qaeda's capacity to deal with more attacks on the United States from that territory. We accomplished both of those objectives -- period.
That's what I believed, from the beginning, why we should be and why we should have gone to Afghanistan. That job had been over for some time. And that's why I believe that this is the right decision and, quite frankly, overdue.
Q: Mr. President, has the civilian government hailed the people of Afghanistan?
Q: Mr. President, thank you very much. Your own intelligence community has assessed that the Afghan government will likely collapse.
THE PRESIDENT: That is not true.
Q: Is it -- can you please clarify what they have told you about whether that will happen or not?
THE PRESIDENT: That is not true. They did not -- they didn't -- did not reach that conclusion.
Q: So what is the level of confidence that they have that it will not collapse?
THE PRESIDENT: The Afghan government and leadership has to come together. They clearly have the capacity to sustain the government in place. The question is: Will they generate the kind of cohesion to do it? It's not a question of whether they have the capacity. They have the capacity. They have the forces. They have the equipment. The question is: Will they do it?
And I want to make clear what I made clear to Ghani: that we are not going just sus- -- walk away and not sustain their ability to maintain that force. We are. We're going to also work to make sure we help them in terms of everything from food necessities and other things in -- in the region. But -- but, there's not a conclusion that, in fact, they cannot defeat the Taliban.
I believe the only way there's going to be -- this is now Joe Biden, not the intelligence community -- the only way there's ultimately going to be peace and security in Afghanistan is that they work out a modus vivendi with the Taliban and they make a judgment as to how they can make peace.
And the likelihood there's going to be one unified government in Afghanistan controlling the whole country is highly unlikely.
Q: Mr. President, thank you. But we have talked to your own top general in Afghanistan, General Scott Miller. He told ABC News the conditions are so concerning at this point that it could result in a civil war. So, if Kabul falls to the Taliban, what will the United States do about it?
THE PRESIDENT: Look, you've said two things -- one, that if it could result in a civil war -- that's different than the Taliban succeeding, number one. Number two, the question of what will be done is going to be implicated -- is going to implicate the entire region as well. There's a number of countries who have a grave concern about what's going to happen in Afghanistan relative to their security.
The question is: How much of a threat to the United States of America and to our allies is whatever results in terms of a government or an agreement? That's when that judgement will be made.
Q: Mr. President, some Vietnamese veterans see echoes of their experience in this withdrawal in Afghanistan. Do you see any parallels between this withdrawal and what happened in Vietnam, with some people feeling --
THE PRESIDENT: None whatsoever. Zero. What you had is -- you had entire brigades breaking through the gates of our embassy -- six, if I'm not mistaken.
The Taliban is not the south -- the North Vietnamese army. They're not -- they're not remotely comparable in terms of capability. There's going to be no circumstance where you see people being lifted off the roof of a embassy in the -- of the United States from Afghanistan. It is not at all comparable.
Q: And, Mr. President --
Q: Mr. President, can I --
THE PRESIDENT: I'll take him and then I'll -- and then I'll go -- I'll go to the other side. Hang on a second.
Q: Mr. President, how serious was the corruption among the Afghanistan government to this mission failing there?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, first of all, the mission hasn't failed, yet. There is in Afghanistan -- in all parties, there's been corruption. The question is, can there be an agreement on unity of purpose? What is the objective?
For example, it started off -- there were going to be negotiations between the Taliban and the Afghan National Security Forces and the Afghan government. That -- that of -- it didn't come to -- it didn't come to fruition.
So the question now is, where do they go from here? That -- the jury is still out. But the likelihood there's going to be the Taliban overrunning everything and owning the whole country is highly unlikely.
Yes, ma'am.
Q: Mr. President, will the United States be responsible for the loss of Afghan civilian lives that could happen after a --
THE PRESIDENT: No.
Q: -- military exit?
THE PRESIDENT: No, no, no. It's up to the people of Afghanistan to decide on what government they want, not us to impose the government on them. No country has ever been able to do that.
Keep in mind, as a student of history, as I'm sure you are, never has Afghanistan been a united country, not in all of its history. Not in all of its history.
Q: Mr. President, if this isn't a ""mission accomplished"" moment, what is it, in your view?
THE PRESIDENT: No, there's no ""mission accomplished.""
Q: How would you describe it?
THE PRESIDENT: The mission was accomplished in that we get -- got Osama bin Laden, and terrorism is not emanating from that part of the world.
Q: Mr. President, if ""speed is safety,"" as you just said in your remarks, are you satisfied with the timeline of relocating Afghan nationals? Is it happening quickly enough to your satisfaction, if it may not happen until next month, at the end?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, much of it has already happened. There's already been people -- about a thousand people have gotten on aircraft and come home -- come to the United States already on commercial aircraft. So, as I said, there's over 2,500 people that as -- from January to now, have gotten those visas. And only half decided that they wanted to leave.
The point is that I think the whole process has to be speeded up, period, in terms of being able to get these visas.
Q: Why can't the U.S. evacuate these Afghan translators to the United States to await their visa processing as some immigrants at the southern border have been allowed to do?
THE PRESIDENT: Because the law doesn't allow that to happen. And that's why we're asking the Congress to consider changing the law.
But in the meantime, we can guarantee their safety, if they wish to leave, by taking them to third countries and/or, while the wait is taking place, to come to -- to -- and hopefully, while they're waiting there, to be able to bring them back to the United States, if that's what they choose to do.
Q: And what do you make -- and what do you make, sir, of the Taliban being in Russia today?
Q: Mr. President, I'm from Afghanistan. I am Afghan (inaudible) woman. Any message -- good message for Afghan women in future? Because they have achievement -- they are really concerned about their achievement.
THE PRESIDENT: They are very concerned, with good reason.
Q: Yes.
THE PRESIDENT: When I was in Afghanistan -- I've been there a number of times -- I remember being in a school outside and -- and, by the way, the schools in Afghanistan are not fundamentally unlike schools in the West Coast, where they have, you know, a -- an area in the middle that is sort of like -- it looks like a playground and single-story buildings connected around it.
And I remember saying to -- speaking to a group of young women -- I guess they were roughly -- don't hold me to this -- they look like they'd be 14, 15 years old. And they're in school, and there's a tiered classroom with single light bulbs hanging from the ceiling, as I know you know.
And I said, ""You know, the United States came here to make sure that we got this terrorist, Osama bin Laden, and that terrorists didn't amass again to -- to go after our country. And then we're going to have to leave."" And a young woman said, ""You can't leave. You can't leave."" It was -- it was heartbreaking. ""You can't leave,"" she said. ""I want to be a doctor. I want to be a doctor. I want to be a doctor. If you leave, I'll never be able to be a doctor."" Well, that's why we spent so much time and money training the Afghan Security Forces to do the work of defending that. If every work --
Well, anyway -- so, yes, I'm aware.
I'm going to take one more question.
Q: Mr. President, have you spoken with any Taliban officials about the withdrawal?
Q: (Inaudible) the Taliban being in Russia today -- the Taliban --
Q: Mr. -- Mr. President, I -- thank you. I wanted to ask: With the benefit of hindsight, you've spoken to the fact that the Taliban are sort of at their militarily strongest point that you've seen in 20 years. How do you feel personally about that, with the benefit of hindsight and all of the dollars and investments and American troops that were sent there?
THE PRESIDENT: Relative to the training and capacity of the ANSF and the training of the federal police, they're not even close in terms of their capacity.
I was making the point -- the point was that here we were; I was -- the argument is, ""Well, we could stay because no one was dying. No Americans are being shot. So why leave?"" Once the agreement was made by the last administration that we were going to leave by May 1st, it was very clear that a Taliban that had always been a problem was even a more sophisticated problem than they were than before. Not more sophisticated than the ANSF, the government. More than they were.
The point being that it would have increased the prospect that they would have been able to take more lives of Americans if they decided we weren't going to go after them. That was the point I was making.
Thank you all so very much. Thank you.

Remarks at McHenry County College in Crystal Lake, Illinois
","
THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Edith. Thank you, thank you, thank you. (Applause.) Please. Please, be seated.
Mr. President -- what he hadn't told you today: He had to delay his vacation to be here today. (Laughter.) He heard Biden is coming. He goes, ""Oh, my God, when is he coming?"" (Laughter.) But -- (laughs) -- so he could show me around McHenry County College.
I'm glad to be here with great Illinois leaders. I want you all to -- you know, America is back. America is back. (Applause.) And in no small part because of the men and women that I serve with.
Governor Pritzker, stand up, man. Stand up. (Applause.) This is a good man.
If you really want someone in a foxhole with you when you're in trouble, you want Senator Tammy Duckworth. Tammy. (Applause.)
And the guy I rely on more than anyone else in the United States Senate -- and I've served with him for years; we have a lot in common in terms of losses as well as gains -- is Dick Durbin. Dick. (Applause.)
And Congresswoman Underwood, who got me a passport to her town. (Applause.) Her mom and dad are mildly proud with good reason. (Laughter.) Good reason. Actually, her mom looks like her sister. (Laughter.)
Last week, I was up in Wisconsin to talk about a bipartisan agreement to modernize American infrastructure and, in the process, create millions of good-paying jobs. That's not my estimate -- that's Wall Street estimates; that's everybody's estimate. Millions of good-paying jobs. Not $7, not $8, not $10, not even $15 an hour. Good prevailing-wage jobs. (Applause.)
And here's what it means for Illinois: You've got, like many states -- all states -- you've got 230- -- 2,374 bridges and over 6,200 miles of highway that are in disrepair.
As a result, every driver in this state pays a hidden tax
of about $600 per year in wasted time and wasted fuel because of the nature of the roads and bridges -- and, by the way, you're better than a lot of states -- not to mention the challenge of getting to work or getting to the daycare center on time to avoid that late fee when you pick up your child.
Your governor has an ambitious infrastructure plan, and under a bipartisan infrastructure agreement, we're going to make the biggest investment in roads and bridges since the construction of the Interstate Highway System, literally creating millions of good-paying jobs. (Applause.)
And God willing, we're not going to have 40 -- 40 weeks of ""This is Infrastructure Week."" (Laughter.) Remember those?
Think what it will mean to McHenry's entrepreneurial agricultural program if we can get products more easily to Chicago. Think about how much easier life will be when it's quicker to drive on Randall Road. (Laughter.)
Look, this agreement also allows us to replace every lead pipe and service line in America, benefitting 10 million homes. (Applause.) It's going to address -- it's going to address lead exposure to 400,000 of our schools and daycare facilities where children drink that water. This would be the largest investment in clean drinking water in American history when we pass it.
In every -- 1 in every 10 people in Illinois lacks access to high-speed Internet. The bipartisan agreement that Dick and others have made sure we're getting -- the agreement allows us to connect every American to reliable, high-speed, affordable Internet -- every single American, rural and urban. And, by the way, those of you who are parents, who had kids at home, tell me what Internet means this last year. (Laughter.) If they're school age.
Well, from 2010 to 2020, Illinois experienced 49 extreme weather events -- although I heard today from the senator north of here that there -- a Republican senator -- there is no global warming. Just so you know, there's no such thing. (Laughter.)
But those weather events cost this state roughly $50 billion in damages. And we're going to up upgrade the electric grid to make it more resilient to extreme weather and other threats.
There's a lot more the agreement is going to do to encourage the physical and ensure -- the physical infrastructure lays the foundation for a strong, durable, and sustainable competitive economy.
But what I want to talk to you about today is human infrastructure. It's essential to that foundation, as well. To truly win the 21st century and once again lead the world, to truly build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out, to truly deal everybody in this time, we need to invest in our people. We need to invest in our people.
That's why, in addition to the bipartisan infrastructure agreement that I believe we're going to get done, I'm here to make the case for the second critical part of my domestic agenda. It's a combination of parts of my American Jobs Plan that were essential and not included in the bipartisan infrastructure plan, as well as my American Families Plan.
In Washington, they call it a ""reconciliation bill."" That's a fancy way of saying, with a filibuster that our friends on the other side use constantly -- more than ever been used in history -- it means you got to get 60 votes to get anything done. We're 50-50 Senate with a Vice President who happens to be a Democrat.
And back in the campaign, you know, I said we're going to build back, and we're going to build back better. Not just -- we can't just build back; we got to build back better.
And today, I want to outline some of the key pieces of this Build Back Better agenda and what's it going to do for the people of Illinois and the people of the United States.
It's about a country, once again, that inspires and leads the world with the opportunities we provide, the cures we discovery, the technolog- -- that we discover -- the technologies we pioneer, and industries we create. You know, and a nation that leads the world in combatting the existential threat of climate change.
The Build Back Better plan -- agenda starts with education. You know, one of the reasons why we were the leading country in the world for so long, and still on the edge, is because we're the first nation -- industrial nation in the world to require -- to allow 12 years of free education back at the turn of the 20th century. But everybody is caught up.
At the time, they were debating what should be education in America. The argument was there should be 12 years of free education. And that's what's got us ahead. That's what had us leap ahead of the rest of the world.
But as (inaudible) today, everybody is caught up. Does anybody think, in the 21st century, with the change that's taking place in technology and across the board, that 12 years of education is enough to be able to live a middle-class life? I don't think so.
And so, the fact of the matter is we've decided -- I've decided we should have a minimum of 14 years of education. Fourteen years of education -- which I'll explain in a second.
You know, as the First Lady -- I'm Jill Biden's husband, but -- (laughter) -- but as Jill would say -- and she's a full-time community college professor while being the First Lady -- she often says, ""Any nation that out-educates us is going to out-compete us."" Any nation that out-educates us is going to out compete us.
That's why I want to guarantee an additional four additional years of public education for every person in America, starting with providing two years of universal, high-quality preschool for three- and four-year-olds, building -- (applause) -- building on what the governor has been doing here in Illinois. (Applause.)
In the last 10 years, studies out of the great universities -- study of a high-quality program here in Chicago -- found that low-income children participating in preschool were 47 percent more likely to earn an associate's degree or higher, and get through school without any difficulty. We have to build on that foundation for future success. And then I want to add two years of free community college for everyone. (Applause.)
And we can afford it. I'll tell you how.
That can boost the earnings of a high school graduate with low-wage jobs by nearly $6,000 a year on average.
The average annual cost of a two-year degree in Illinois is $4,200. Under my proposal, that cost would be zero. (Applause.)
But it's not just tuition that's expensive; as was pointed out, living expenses, housing, meals, transportation. And that's why I propose to increase a maximum Pell Grant -- which, if you are below a certain income, you qualify for a Pell Grant -- from about $6,500 to $8,000 a year. (Applause.) And that will fill it out.
I know -- I know that here at McHenry, you have a dual enrollment program so students from places like Woodstock High School and other high schools, you get credit for taking college classes here. Well, my plan will -- will provide resources to expand programs like the one you have here.
My plan will also do more to invest in high-quality job training and apprenticeships in fast-growing sectors like public health, childcare, manufacturing, information technology, clean energy so that all Americans can get the skills that employers want that lead to good middle-class and -- I was -- I make no apology -- union jobs. (Applause.)
It would also -- it would also make strategic investments in teachers -- in the teacher pipeline. Because even before the pandemic, our school system was 100,000 teachers short here in America, particularly in high-demand areas.
Our children are the kite strings that lift our national ambitions aloft, and our teachers are the ones that help them
believe they can do anything. I bet every one of your success can name the teacher that helped change your life. I bet every one -- every one of us. There's somebody who came along and made us believe in ourselves. That's the really sec- -- the secret of teachers.
My plan will reduce student debt for future teachers, double the size of the annual federal scholarships for future teachers.
We'll also support $100 billion in school infrastructure improvements, including community college, to make sure that they are safe and healthy places for learning, and that all students -- with the labs and technology they need to be able to compete in the 21st century.
Of course, an ability to take these jobs often depends on the availability of childcare. As a single father, when I was first got to the Senate, I had two young boys who had just lost their mom and their sister in an automobile accident. If I hadn't had the family I have -- my sister, best -- my younger sister, my best friend, and my brother, and my mom help out -- I couldn't have done it. But not everybody has that kind of support.
I just toured your Children's Learning Center. It's an amazing resource. Students and faculty can have their children cared for. Students can earn their associate degrees in early childhood education as well. High-quality childcare options should be the rule, not the exception.
So, on my way in here, I met with Mike Sayre, who wrote me a letter about his struggle to find affordable childcare, and he wanted me to -- he wanted to know what my plans were. Well, Mike, I hope you know now. Here we are.
My plan is to provide access to quality, affordable childcare with more childcare centers in community college campuses with new and upgraded childcare facilities all across the country. (Applause.)
Businesses -- businesses will get a full tax credit to build on-site facilities. And the reason they want to do that is not just to be nice. Business -- because studies show when there's an on-site childcare center, businesses have less employee turnover, less absenteeism, and higher productivity. It's overwhelmingly in their interest to do it.
Middle-class families will pay no more than 7 percent of their income for high-quality childcare for children up to age five. And the most hard-pressed working families won't have to pay a dime.
My plan will also invest in childcare workforce with better wages, benefits, and training opportunities.
Look, we're also going to give parents the option to take up to an $8,000 tax credit to cover childcare expenses, if that's the preferred route. That's good for families and it's good for our economy, and it will create more jobs.
My plan will also provide up to 12 weeks of paid family leave for medical -- (applause) -- up to 12 weeks of paid family leave. Look, we're one of the few major economies in the world that doesn't cover paid family and medical leave.
And the most difficult moments some will ever face:
No one should have to choose between a job and a paycheck and take caring of someone you love -- a parent, a spouse, a child.
Look, we will tackle the maternal mortality crisis, as well, that impacts on Black and Native American mothers disproportionately. And what -- and I want to thank Congresswoman Underwood for her leadership in this area. (Applause.) For real.
As I've said again and again, people who really need a tax break in this country are America's working families. It's time they get a tax break.
So, my Build Back Better agenda would extend the expanded Child Tax Credit we passed under my American Rescue Plan. Those of you who have children under the age of seven [six], you're going to get -- and depending on your income -- your income taxes -- you're going to get a cash payment back. Up to now, guess what? You get $2,000 to declare a dependent. If you have two children, you get $4,000 off a $10,000 tax bill. It's important.
But if you don't have enough -- you don't have enough -- you don't make enough money to be able to have -- to owe that kind of tax, you don't get a tax credit, you don't get anything. Well, under this proposal, guess what? You're in a situation where if you have a child under the age of seven [six], you get back $3,600 in cash. In addition to that, those of you who are in that situation are going to start to see that coming in by the end of this month, on a monthly basis. It can change the lives of people.
Starting next week, families will begin to receive one of the largest-ever single-year tax cuts aimed to families with children. And every child under age 6 is $3,600; every child between 6 and 17 is $3,000. It's not as a credit against your taxes, but a direct payment. You'll get cash. Cash. That's what you'll get.
For example, a middle-class family with two children can expect to receive $7,200. You'll get the first half -- the $3,600 -- paid out at $600 a month between July and December, and you'll get the rest between January and Tax Day.
With this one tax cut, every study shows that childcare -- childcare is cutting poverty in ha- -- by 40 percent. Families with children who qualify for this, it cuts poverty by 40 percent.
So, let's extend the tax cut at least through 2025, and let's expand -- (applause) -- let's expand free meals for millions more children in schools, with the assistance during the summer months when they don't have access to those school meals.
We support families with children. We also need to provide greater dignity for our nation's senior citizens who care for them.
Look, there are hundreds of thousands of older adults
and people with disabilities who need home- and community-based care services. They qualify for it under Medicaid, but there's a backlog of thousands of people. But one study showed that $3,000 spent helping a senior stay in their home by providing -- it saves the country more than $20,000 a year in medical costs.
At the same time, more than 1.5 million Americans work in homecare. They're disproportionately women, women of color, and immigrants, and those jobs are among the lowest paid in our economy. One in six homecare workers lives in poverty. We need to do better on both sides of the equation.
My plan expands homecare for older and disabled Americans,
while improving jobs and pay for homecare workers who care for them.
And here's the deal: You save a lot of money if you don't have to go to a home. Keeping people in their own home, mentally and every other way, is a benefit -- a significant benefit for the community, as well as cost.
We also need to continue to make healthcare more affordable. When we lowered premiums and expanded coverage for the American Re- -- in my American Rescue Plan, more than 1.5 million people signed up for what used to be called ""Obamacare."" I want to make these premium reductions permanent so we can get even more people covered.
We need to deal with the shortage of affordable housing in America. Over 10 million renters in this country pay more than half their income for the rent on their apartment, and the lack of affordable housing prevents people from moving to communities where there are more opportunities.
So we're going to make historic investment in affordable housing, increasing and improving the housing supply by building and rehabilitating more than 2 million homes, especially in places that need more housing.
And we need to invest not just in the physical and human infrastructure of today, we need to invest in the jobs and industries of tomorrow.
Three decades ago -- and this always disturbs me, even just repeating it -- three decades ago, the United States was number one in the world for a share of their GDP being invested in research and development. We were number one in the world. We're now number eight [nine] in the world. Number eight [nine] in the world. China was number -- or -- excuse me, we're -- China was number nine [eight] in the world; now they're number two in the world.
Folks, Democrats and Republicans agree we can't afford to lose this race. They came together in the Senate on an Innovation and Competition Act -- that Dick was very much a part of -- to help us grow the industries that win the jobs of the future.
We need to lay the foundation for the next generation of American jobs and American leadership in manufacturing and technology.
We're going to invest in Historically Black Colleges and Universities and other Minority-Serving Institutions because while these schools may not have the endowments or the labs needed to generate these jobs, these students are just as capable of learning about all of the things that are going to provide the jobs of the future.
And, of course, no challenge is as urgent as climate change. Last week, I met with eight governors for a better part of an hour, all from the western states, Republicans and Democrats. They're facing extreme heat, record drought,
and a fire season that threatens to be much longer and more dangerous and more destructive than ever.
Last year, for example, more than 10 million acres burned in the West -- 10 million acres -- not counting the lives lost and homes lost. More land than exists in my home state of Delaware and my neighboring state of Maryland combined. So if a fire swept through and took out every single thing in the state of Delaware and Maryland. The drought conditions, this year, are twice as bad. You've seen the pictures. Reservoirs that are 40 feet down, 50 feet down.
The extreme weather isn't just in the West. In Illinois, farmers downstate are dealing with more frequent droughts. And two weeks ago, just south of here, you just had a nearly unprecedented tornado.
We can't wait any longer to deal with the climate crisis. We see it with our own eyes, and it's time to act.
The bipartisan agreement we reached makes some major strides. It's going to allow the transition of thousands of old, for example, of diesel school buses and buses -- city buses. We're going to change them to electric buses. There are roughly a half a million of these iconic yellow school buses on the road today. Ninety-five percent of them run on diesel, for example. And diesel pollutes the air and is linked to asthma and other health problems, and it hurts our communities and it causes our students to miss school.
I'll put Americans to work capping tens of thousands of abandoned oil and gas wells that are leaking methane. It's devastating. And the wages to fill these -- cap these wells are the same wages that it took to dig the wells, making people earn -- be able to earn a prevailing wage to do it. There's thousands of them.
But we need to go further.
I want to provide tax cuts for businesses and consumers who invest in clean energy technologies like renewables, battery storage, next-generation aviation fuels, electric vehicles.
I want to set the clean electricity standard that moves us to a fully clean and reliable grid.
These steps are going to create good-paying union jobs and spur demand for domestic manufacturing, accelerating clean energy and clean cars, growing our capacity to build those technologies on factory floors with union workers, here in the United States.
And we create a new generation of jobs in clean energy and manufacturing. And I also want to enlist a new generation of climate, conservation, and reliance workers -- excuse me, resilience workers -- like FDR did when the American work plan -- preserving our landscape with a Civilian Conservation Corps. It's a similar thing.
We can put Americans to work strengthening public lands and waters, and making our communities -- rural and urban -- more resilient against extreme weather. And we can take on the long-overdue work of advancing environmental justice by addressing pollution.
My plan is also going to give grants to spur innovative policies and land projects -- lo- -- excuse me, local projects, like installing community solar and storage and disadvanta- -- in disadvantaged communities; replacing streetlights that are made in America with LED bulbs that cost a whole lot less and last a whole lot longer; making upgrades in homes and schools
and community centers to boost energy efficiency and cut electric bills.
Folks, I've laid out a lot of plans here, but that's because it's time, and we have to think bigger, and we have to act bolder, and we have to build back better.
When we passed the American Rescue Plan, the naysayers and the doubters said it wouldn't work. Well, we've created over 3 million jobs since I took office -- more jobs in the first months of a presidential administration than any time in American history.
And last week, the Congressional Budget Office
doubled their projections of the 2021 economic growth from 3.2 percent to 7.4 percent, and the OECD thinks it could be higher. That puts the America Rescue Plan -- and our work is going to move forward to do a lot of things, including -- we're close to defeating the virus.
The last time energy -- the economy grew at this rate was in 1984 and Ronald Reagan was telling us it was an American morning. Well, this is going to be an American century. (Applause.)
With my American Families Plan and the other elements of the Build Back Better agenda, experts and Wall Street analysts have said that we'll create millions of good-paying jobs for years and decades to come, not just in the near term.
So, I'm going to be making the case to the American people until the job is done, until we bring this bipartisan deal home, until we meet the needs of families today and the economy of tomorrow. And we can pay for it.
Let me give you a rough example. This isn't -- you know, and by the way, the American -- the -- the plan for infrastructure is paid for. It's paid for. And this plan that I'm talking about -- which is really expensive if you add it all up -- well, guess what? The fact is that it's paid for as well. And let me tell you how we're going to pay for it.
Some of the ways to pay for the rest of it is: The last couple of years, for example, 55 of the Fortune 500 companies making billions of dollars did not pay a single penny in taxes -- not one single cent.
Well, I don't want to punish anybody, but everybody -- and I hope someday my grandchildren grow up to be billionaires. That'd be wonderful, especially for a guy who for 36 years was listed as the poorest man in United States Congress. (Laughter.)
But having said that, all kidding aside, everybody has to pay their fair share. I'm not trying to gouge anybody, but, I mean, just get in the game.
If we put in place a minimum 15 percent tax on the profits of corporations, the ones that didn't pay any tax, that would raise a quarter of a trillion dollars -- $240 billion.
But there's a loophole in the system called ""stepped-up basis."" That loophole goes: If I made a capital gains and I was a wealthy person, and I was going to cash in my stock, and I was going to have to pay a tax, I was going to make, you know, $400,000, and I was going to pay X amount of taxes -- if, on the way to cash it in I get hit by a truck, God forbid, and died, and it was left to my daughter, there would be no tax paid. It's not an inheritance tax. It was a tax due 10 seconds earlier.
We closed that loophole, and that saves us $400 billion a year -- not a year -- $400 billion over this period, which is enough to pay for the Child -- Child Care Tax Credit.
If we end tax breaks for fossil fuels, and make polluters pay to clean up the messes they've made, that would raise $90 billion. We're not asking them to do anything that -- that is unfair; we're just not going to subsidize them anymore. They're doing well, thank -- thank you. And the messes they made, they should clean up.
Well, if we ask the top 1 percent -- and I hope many of you are in the top 1 percent -- maybe. (Laughter.)
You know, that tax cut that was passed in 2017 was all -- it raised the deficit by over $2 trillion -- not a penny paid for, and it didn't come back with anything. That -- that, in fact -- that entire $2 trillion -- the vast majority went to the top one-tenth of 1 percent of the American people.
One percent -- you know, if we just -- 1 percent -- the folks in the top 1 percent, if they just paid their personal income state tax, the same as it was under President George Bush -- George W. Bush -- that would generate $13 billion a year. It would raise the tax from what it is now, 35, to 39 percent. It's what it -- I mean, it's not like this idea where you'd listen to the guy that used to have his job that somehow we're gouging people.
The fact of the matter is, a lot of you, if you're -- if you're a plumber or a teacher, you're probably paying 25, 26 percent. Some of you be paying higher.
But, here, look: It's enough to provide for -- that one change -- enough to provide for two years free community college for every student in America.
Now -- (applause) -- now, people say that one of the purposes of taxes is to also generate growth along with making sure that we can pay for our basic needs.
Well, let me ask you, what is more likely to grow the economy and enhance us: continuing the tax cut at 37 percent, or spending -- having to pay 39-point -- and a half percent, generating economic growth? Because now you have a tax system that will allow millions of students to go to community college.
When I was with Barack as Vice President, he asked me to do a study. And I spent -- and I -- your sister, Penny Pritzker, was part of my effort to taking care of it. And the effort was simple. It came along, and we said, ""Okay, what do we…"" -- and we (inaudible) three hundred and, I think, forty-seven -- don't hold me to the exact number -- of the CEOs of the Fortune 500 companies. Said, ""What do you need most?"" You know what they said to almost -- to a person? ""I need a better-educated workforce."" They're not prepared to pay for it.
Imagine if we present the world a nation with a better educated workforce. It helps everybody. The point is, we can pay for our entire plan and make the tax system fairer for all Americans. It's about time.
There's a lot of work ahead of us to finish the job, but we're going to get it done. We're going to reimagine what our economy and our future could be, and show the world -- just as importantly, we'll show ourselves -- that democracy -- democracy can deliver for the people of Illinois and the people of America, and the world can lead again. (Applause.)
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. I know that's a boring speech, but it's an important speech.
God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate it.
And excuse my back. I apologize. I apologize. Thank you. (Applause.)

Q: Mr. President, Mitch McConnell says you're in for a heck of a fight on this one.
THE PRESIDENT: Mitch McConnell loves our programs. Did you see what Mitch McConnel said? He told me he wasn't going to get a single vote in order to allow me to get, with the help of everybody here, that $1.9 trillion tax cut -- I mean, excuse me, program to -- for economic growth.

Remarks on Independence Day
","
Today -- today we celebrate America -- (applause) -- our freedom, our liberty, our independence. The Fourth of July is a sacred day in our country -- a day of history, of hope, remembrance and resolve, of promise and possibilities.
Before me stands monuments of the greatest and the goodness of our nation -- monuments of light and liberty. There's a towering memorial to George Washington -- the general who led our Revolution and the President who set our nation on its course.
There's a memorial to Thomas Jefferson, whose words about liberty and equality literally changed the world.
And across the Tidal Basin from the Jefferson Memorial, there stands Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. -- his arms crossed, his eyes fixed ahead toward the promised land where equality is not only an aspiration, but a reality. (Applause.)
They helped define who we are, guide what we do, remind us of the work that history has given us in our own time.
This year, the Fourth of July is a day of special celebration, for we are emerging from the darkness of years; a year of pandemic and isolation; a year of pain, fear, and heartbreaking loss.
Just think back to where this nation was a year ago. Think back to where you were a year ago. And think about how far we've come.
From silent streets -- (applause) -- from silent streets to crowded parade routes lined with people waving American flags; from empty stadiums and arenas to fans back to their seats cheering together again; from families pressing hands against a window to grandparents hugging their grandchildren once again.
We're back traveling again. We're back seeing one another again. Businesses are opening and hiring again. We're seeing record job creation and record economic growth -- the best in four decades and, I might add, the best in the world. (Applause.)
Today, all across this nation, we can say with confidence: America is coming back together. (Applause.)
Two hundred and forty-five years ago, we declared our independence from a distant king. Today, we're closer than ever to declaring our independence from a deadly virus. That's not to say the battle against COVID-19 is over. We've got a lot more work to do.
But just as our Declaration in 1776 was not a call to action -- was a call to action, not a reason for complacency or a claim of victory -- it was a call to action -- the same is true today.
Back then, we had the power of an idea on our side. Today, we have the power of science. (Applause.) Thanks to our heroic vaccine effort, we've gained the upper hand against this virus. We can live our lives, our kids can go back to school, our economy is roaring back.
Don't get me wrong, COVID-19 is -- has not been vanquished. We all know powerful variants have emerged, like the Delta variant, but the best defense against these variants is to get vaccinated. (Applause.)
My fellow Americans, it's the most patriotic thing you can do. So, please, if you haven't gotten vaccinated, do it -- do it now for yourself, for your loved ones, for your community, and for your country.
You know, that's how we're going to stay ahead of these variants and protect the hard-won progress we've made. We never again want to be where we were a year ago today. (Applause.)
So, today, while the virus hasn't been vanquished, we know this: It no longer controls our lives. It no longer paralyzes our nation. And it's within our power to make sure it never does again. And for that, we can thank the scientists and researchers, the educators, and all the other frontline and essential workers, like many of you here today -- (applause) --
who became the light to see us through the darkness.
I hope you know that you, the American people, have been part of one of the most remarkable achievements in American history. But in this moment of joy, we know that this day falls hard on all those who've lost a loved one.
So I've told you before: Each day, I carry a card in my pocket with my schedule on it. In the back of that schedule, on that card, are the number of Americans who've lost their lives to COVID -- the precise number.
As of tonight, that number is 603,018 people who have lost their lives. They're husbands and wives, mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, grandparents, friends, neighbors, coworkers.
And we also remember all those who lost this year -- that we lost and families lost to other causes -- other causes of death and cruel twists of fate. They, too, left behind loved ones unable to grieve or mourn or find closure. Each of them meant the world to someone they left behind. And those of you who've been through all this know that to heal, you have to remember. We have to remember them, and we will. We'll commit to always remember them. That's what we'll do.
I've long said that America is unique. Unlike every other nation on Earth, we were founded based on an idea. We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all people are created equal, endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights -- among them life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
And while we've never fully lived up to those words, we have never given up on them. They continue to animate us, and they remind us what, at our best, we as Americans believe: We, Americans -- we believe in honesty and decency, in treating everyone with dignity and respect, giving everyone a fair shot, demonizing no one, giving hate no safe harbor, and leaving no one behind.
We lead by the power of our example, not the example of our power. And we're part of som- -- something so much bigger than ourselves. We stand as a beacon to the world.
It's a code. It's a code -- uniquely American code. It's who we are.
To all the service members and your families who are here tonight, today, all of you serving around the world: It's the greatest honor to serve as your Commander-in-Chief.
Jill and I -- (applause) -- Jill and I, and our entire family, thank you for your service and sacrifice. Like so many military families thinking of your loved ones who served, we think of our son Beau today.
You're all part of a long chain of patriots who pledged their lives and their sacred honor in defense of this nation and democracy around the world; for freedom and fair play; for peace and security and opportunity; for the cause of justice; for the soul of America itself.
But the defense of all that we love doesn't fall on your shoulders alone. It falls on all -- all of us -- every one of us -- every American.
Each day, we're reminded there's nothing guaranteed about our democracy, nothing guaranteed about our way of life. We have to fight for it, defend it, earn it.
Folks, it's up to all of us to protect the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; the right to equal justice under the law; the right to vote and have that vote counted; the right -- (applause) -- the right to breathe clean air, drink clean water, and know that our children and grandchildren will be safe on this planet for generations to come -- (applause); the right to rise in the world as far as your God-given calent [talent] can take you, unlimited by barriers of privilege or power.
One of the great gifts of the spirit of independence -- and think about this: One of the great gifts is our capacity to see ourselves whole and see ourselves honestly -- what we've gotten right, what we've gotten wrong. It's a measure of the greatness of America, and we are a great nation. We don't seek to bury the wrongs. We face it. We work to make it right.
You know, history tells us that when we stand together, when we unite in common cause, when we see ourselves not as Republicans or Democrats, but as Americans, then there's simply no limit to what we can achieve. (Applause.) None.
And today we see the results of the unity of purpose -- the unity of purpose in -- forging in our nati- -- we're forging in our nation, for together we're beating the virus. Together, we're breathing life into our economy. Together, we will rescue our people from division and despair. But together we must do it.
Over the past year, we've lived through some of our darkest days. Now I truly believe -- I give you my word as a Biden -- I truly believe we're about to see our brightest future. (Applause.)
Folks, this is a special nation, a great nation. And there is a timeless truth about America. The most powerful idea in the history of the world [beats] in the hearts of the people of this country. It beats in all our hearts no matter your race or ethnicity; no matter your gender identity or sexual orientation -- (applause); no matter your disability; no matter your faith. It beats in the hearts of rich and poor alike.
It unites America whether your ancestors were native to this land or brought here forcibly and enslaved; whether you were immigrants from generations back -- like my family that came from Ireland -- or you're coming here today looking to build a better life for your family, like our fellow Americans I just swore in, in the White House, two days ago. (Applause.)
The American creed -- we use that phrase, ""the American creed"" -- is we're all equal, created equal. It was written a long time ago. But the genius is that every generation of Americans has expanded it wider and wider to include those who were exc- -- excluded before. That's why it's never gathered dust in our history books. It's still alive today -- alive in our hearts; alive in the work of our hands; alive not only in the history we read, but in the history we're making.
My fellow Americans, now we're the guardians of that very idea of America. It's up to us to save it, to preserve it, to build on it, and I know we will. (Applause.)
On this sacred day, I look out to those monuments on our National Mall and beyond them, into the hearts of our people across the land, and I know this: It's never, ever been a good bet to bet against America -- never. (Applause.)
We just have to remember who we are: We are the United States of America, and there's nothing -- nothing we can't do if we do it together. (Applause.)
Folks, happy Fourth of July, America. (Applause.) God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you. (Applause.)

Remarks at the 2021 National Education Association Annual Meeting
","
THE PRESIDENT: Hello, everyone. They tell me there are a few people out there watching. (Laughter.)
MS. PRINGLE: A couple thousand.
THE PRESIDENT: A couple thousand.
But, look, before I begin my formal comments, as Jill and your president spoke, it reminded me of two things. One is that because of your help, because we were able to pass the American Rescue Plan, we're able to get millions of shots in people's arms and provide vaccines around the world and change the circumstances.
This week -- this Friday -- they announced the new employment figures. Another 800-and-some-thousand jobs created this week. We've now created more jobs since you got me sworn in than any president in American history in the same timeframe.
We are in a situation where we are doing things that I think are going to fundamentally change the trajectory of this country. I told you a long time ago: It's not just the NEA and unions; it's about building America from the middle up and the middle out, not trickling down. There's a lot -- a lot we can do. A lot more we can do.
And, folks, you know, the projected growth rate, before we started -- I just was doing this earlier this morning -- was to be half of what it is now. It's expected to be over 7.2 percent the economy is going to grow this year. That means thousands and thousands and thousands and millions of jobs. And we're just getting started.
So I want to thank you, Madam President, and congratulate you on your first representative assembly of the NEA. (Applause.)
And Jill and I wanted to congratulate you all on the 100th anniversary of this convening. And notwithstanding rumors, I was not at the first convening. (Laughter.)
The NEA is one of America's indispensable organizations. I'm not just saying that because the First Lady is a member. And, by the way, I noticed -- I noticed that what you all -- I knew what you all were going through. Jill taught full-time this semester. Full-time. I watched Jill getting ready to teach her classes.
And going back to school herself, learning how to work online -- and rapidly work online -- and to teach online, it gave me an appreciation firsthand that I thought I had, but I wouldn't have had had I not seen it. And then going out and teaching -- she was working four or five hours a day, getting ready to teach, putting her lesson plans together a different -- a different way.
And you all went through that. All of you went through that.
And again, I'm not saying this because of something Jill -- you know, I would -- the truth: If I didn't support the NEA, I'd be sleeping in the Lincoln Bedroom alone. But -- and that's not where we sleep. We don't sleep in the Lincoln Bedroom. (Laughs.) I'd be sent down to it.
But, you know, look, as Jill always says: Teaching is not what she does, it's who she is. It's who all of you are. Our children are the kite strings upon which our national ambitions are lifted aloft. And your profession -- your profession helps them believe they can do anything.
For that, and so much more, we just wanted to thank you. Thank you all for what you do and what you continue to do.
And, President Pringle, you and I have something in common: We both took our current roles at a time of incredible challenge and incredible opportunity.
Over the last year, the entire country has witnessed the extraordinary dedication and resolve of the NEA members -- teachers, professionals, who had to be not just educators, but tech support, social workers, often while trying to take care of their own children.
Other public employees who kept vital services up and running. I saw the bus drivers dropping off meals instead of picking up kids. Support staff had to become sanitation experts, making sure school buildings were safe. And tech experts making sure everyone could connect to the Internet from home.
You know, there's been so much heroic work to help children stay connected to school and to each other. The American people saw it. They get it. And they understand what you've been saying for years: that you are professionals, all of you. All of you. All of us have a responsibility to make sure that you have what you need to educate our children safely, equitably, and well.
That's why I made it a priority to get educators vaccinated and reopen schools as quickly as possible. Nationwide, 84 percent of K-through-12 educators and school staff are fully vaccinated, and they were by the end of May. Even more have gotten the vaccination since -- the vaccine since.
But as I've said many times, it's not enough just to get back to normal. We have to build back better than ever, especially our education system.
That's why the American Rescue Plan made such historic investments. It was $1.9 trillion, and people said we could never get it passed. With your help, we did, and we transformed the country -- began to transform the country -- providing funding for state and local governors and school districts to make sure schools are safe and to keep you on the job and in the classrooms. Funding for summer learning and tutoring programs and hiring nurses and counselors.
Now we have an opportunity to make the game-changing investments for educators, students, and families, and make it even better.
We're in a competition in the 21st century -- a worldwide competition. And as Jill says often, ""Any country that out-educates us is going to out-compete us."" We have to build for the 21st century because the rest of the world is not sitting around and waiting.
The bipartisan infrastructure agreement we just reached is going to deliver reliable high-speed Internet to every American. Every single American. And they're going to be affordable, in rural and in urban areas.
Of the many things -- of the many tough images this past year were children sitting in cars in fast-food parking lots because it was the only place they could get a Wi-Fi connection for remote schooling.
If we didn't know -- if we didn't know it before, we do now: High-speed Internet is essential like electric and clean air -- like electricity and clean water.
And speaking of clean water, this agreement that we put together will put Americans to work in good-paying union jobs, replacing 100 percent of lead water pipes in this country. One hundred percent.
Right now, there are 400,000 schools -- and some of you teach in them -- 400,000 schools and childcare centers with lead pipes. We know even that low levels of lead can cause behavior and learning problems in children, impairing their growth.
This deal contains the largest investment in clean drinking water in American history. It would end the threat of lead-contamination -- contaminated water once and for all.
My American Families Plan -- which we're now trying to get done as well -- calls for an historic investment in human infrastructure; guaranteeing four additional years of public education for everyone, starting as early as we can; universal high-quality preschool for three- and four-year-olds. And all the data shows how that increases their prospect, no matter what environment they come from, to do better and make it through school. Two years of free community college. And high-quality, affordable childcare for working families.
It would no longer cost -- excuse me, it would lower the cost of lower-income -- for lower-income students going to school -- the Pell grants. We'd provide an additional mil- -- 1.5 -- $1,500 in Pell grants.
It will also make a $9 billion investment in educators so we can address teacher shortages, diversify our pipeline of teachers, and improve teacher training and teacher mentoring. And, critically, it would extend and expanded the Child Tax Credit, which will significantly benefit working families.
What that means: Instead of deducting $2,000 per child off the bottom line of your taxes, --which doesn't do too much for families who don't have a big tax bill to begin with -- pretty soon, before this month is out, families are going to get a significant check. For every child under the age of six, you'll get $3,600 per child. For every child 6 to 17, you'll get $3,000 -- not as a credit against your taxes that a lot of educators and school staff aren't really going to feel. You'll get cash. Cash.
Starting the middle of this month, you'll start to get monthly payments between now and the end of the year. For example, if you have one child, and you're going to get -- you're going to get $3,600. Between now and January, you'll get $1,800 of that on a monthly basis between now and January. And between January and December, you'll get the other $1,800.
Folks, this is a major tax break for working families, and my family plan will extend it for five years. The very -- this year's plan is estimated to cut child poverty in half. In half. The Child Tax Care [Credit].
So, look, folks -- (applause) -- I'm also working with Congress to support $100 billion in school infrastructure investments, making sure that our schools are safe, that you have the technology you need to prepare for students of the future -- something that I've always cared deeply about.
My budget invests $20 billion more in Title I schools. No student -- no student's education should depend on their ZIP code. It would represent a historic effort to close the funding gap between rich and poor districts.
And one of the first things that funding will be used for is to help educators in those schools get the raises they deserve and the resources they need. (Applause.)
And, by the way, if I'd note, this isn't just -- it's not that I'm trying to be nice. This is absolutely necessary -- necessary if we're going to compete in the 21st century. Think about it: The idea that we have a large portion of our student population living in ZIP codes where they cannot afford the kind of education and can't pay the teachers enough in those schools to educate them, it makes no sense. The people that are going to benefit the most from this is corporate America and businesses because they're going to have a better-educated public, better-educated students.
Your union and teachers' protests across the country made it clear that you deserve more than praise. You deserve a raise, not just praise. (Applause.)
And, folks, every parent in this country who spent the last year helping educate their children at home understand you deserve a raise. (Applause.) They figured it out. (Applause.) No, I'm serious. Think about it. Think about it.
It was the ultimate education of the public going through this pandemic.
My budget would also allow us to invest more in counselors, social workers, community schools, nutrition support, and a whole lot more. (Applause.)
I have a lot more to say, but I'm going to get the hook from Jill if I keep talking. (Laughter.)
No, but let's -- so let me close with this: On Sunday, we'll celebrate our independence as a nation, as well as our progress against the virus. In the days ahead, we have a chance to make another beginning -- the beginning of a stronger, fairer education system. But it can't be done -- it can't be done with you. We can't do it alone. We need to keep getting the word out about the opportunities that lies ahead for us.
So, let's make this happen together. I really mean this. This is a -- this is a campaign in and of itself. Jill and I are proud of you. We're grateful to you. And I really mean that.
You know, I think about it: Why would a kid like me, from Scranton and Claymont, Delaware, be standing here as your President of the United States of America, were it not for the people who educated me, the teachers I had? It made a difference. They took a stuttering kid who couldn't -- couldn't -- couldn't -- couldn't speak very well in school, was scared to death to be called on to read out loud.
And they nurtured me: ""Joey -- you're a very smart boy, Joey. Just take your time. Don't let that get in your way, Joey."" I'm serious. I think what you all underestimate, beyond the teaching of reading and writing, adding and subtracting: You give so many kids confidence.
You let them believe in themselves. I'm not joking. Think about yourself, your own -- you can name the teachers who helped change your life. You can name them. I can still name them. I know who the -- the people who made a difference in my life, made me believe I could do anything. When, if you looked at the background, there's no reason why, coming from my circumstance. We weren't -- it wasn't poverty, just -- just making it. But you did it, and don't forget it. Don't forget how much difference you make.
Those of you who've been teaching a while, you have experiences like Jill has. People will come up to Jill and say, ""Mrs. Biden, you had -- I had your English class. I can't thank you…"" ""What are you doing now?"" ""Well, I have my doctorate, and I'm teaching at such and such."" Or a fireman putting out a fire in our home: ""Mrs. Biden…"" -- as his gear coming out of a house that almost burned down -- ""Mrs. Biden, you had me. You had me as a teacher, and you taught me English."" Think of the people's lives you change.
You know, I'm supposed to stop but I'm going to say a couple more things -- (laughter) -- because I -- I really don't think you understand or you appreciate just how important you are. I really mean it. I genuinely mean it from the bottom of my heart.
I was overseas at what they call the G7 -- the biggest economies in the world -- and then with the NATO people, and then I met with Putin. And in the process of doing all of this, I was asked at one point, ""Can you define America for me?"" And I give you my word to this. I said, ""Yes…"" -- and I believe this, and I repeated it again today as I swore in new citizens, young people in the White House. I said, ""I can define America"" -- and I mean it from the bottom of my heart -- ""in one word: possibilities."" It's the only nation in the world where we think we can do anything.
Now, why do we think that? Not a joke. Why do we think that? Why do we think anything is possible? It's not just the system. It's the people who look out for us.
I've said a hundred times, you control -- you, the teachers, determine what this country is going to look like. You are the people who take our children and nurture them. As I said many times, they're the kite string -- you're the kite strings upon which we lift our national ambitions aloft. So, have -- understand how important you are.
And, by the way, understand how important that cafeteria worker is who looks at that kid who's a little bit ashamed that they have no food at home and says, ""Honey, here. Here is a little more. Take some more."" Or packs a little bag without telling them after they have lunch and slips it to them. You provide their dignity. You give them dignity.
So, I really mean it: I think you're the single most important component of America's future. So don't give up on yourselves, and I know you won't. Don't give up on these kids. Give them hope. Make them believe in themselves. And make sure when they're much older, and they say, ""How'd you get here?"" ""Because Mrs. Jones or Mr. Williams,"" or whomever. Because it will be done. It will be done.
Thank you. Thank you for all you do, all you give, and all that you are to your students and to the nation. You know you affect your students, but it's to the nation.
God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you so much. (Applause.)

All right. You get to -- and, by the way, if you're around on Sunday, we're going to -- you'll see the fireworks -- Fourth of July, our Independence Day. (Laughter.)
Mr. Secretary, thank you for administering the oath. I know how meaningful this event is to you personally and professionally. And I thank you and the Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Tracy -- where is Tracy? She -- there you go, Tracy. Thank you very much -- appreciate it -- for joining us in this service.
Look, today -- today's special guests -- to all of you: It is my honor to congratulate the 21 of you for -- who earned the title of -- that our democracy, in every -- is equal to being President -- it's of the same consequence: citizen -- citizen of the United States of America.
You have each come to America from different circumstances and different reasons and 16 different nationalities.
But like previous generations of immigrants, there is one trait you all share in common: courage. It takes courage to get up and leave everything you know and go to another place, no matter where it is. You know, the only homes you've ever known, the lives, the loved ones who weren't able to come -- for a new start in the United States of America.
If I could hold a second and just point out that I -- I'm often asked by -- by world leaders that I'm with, particularly autocrats: How can I define America?
I was with Xi Jinping in -- on the Tibetan Plateau, and he asked me that when I traveled with him 17,000 miles. And it was a private meeting -- just he and I and a contemporaneous translator. He said, ""Can you define America for me?"" I said, ""Yeah, I can, in one word -- one word: possibilities."" Possibilities. It's what America is built on. It's one of the reasons why we're viewed sometimes as being somewhat egotistical. We believe anything is possible in America. Anything is possible in America.
I think about my own family's journey here -- at least two thirds of it came from -- got on a coffin ship in the Irish Sea, back in 1849, having no idea whether they'd make it across the Atlantic to the United States, then to the col- -- to the United States of America, but certain if they did, they could do better. And they did. They did better, and they eventually built a life and raised a family in Scranton, Pennsylvania, over generations.
And here I stand on the shoulders and sacrifices of my great-great-grandfather, my great-grandfather, my -- and just all that they did because they believed -- they believed like you believe: Anything is possible.
So I want to thank you all for choosing us, and I mean that sincerely. Thank you for choosing the United States of America, believing that America is worthy of your aspirations, worthy of your dreams.
Making this journey, you have done more than move to a new place. I've often said that America is the only nation in the world founded on an idea. Every other nation in the world is founded on the basis of either that -- geography or ethnicity or religion. You can define every -- almost everyone else based on those characteristics, but you can't define America. I defy you to tell me what constitutes an American. You can't do it. We're an incredibly diverse democracy.
But there is one thing that does define us a country: We were founded on an idea that, ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men [and women] are created equal…endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights…Life, Liberty, [and] the pursuit of Happiness."" It sounds corny to Americans, as we learn this in grade school and high school. We've never fully lived up to it, but we've never, ever, ever walked away from it. Every generation opens that aperture a little bit wider.
You know, they go back -- as I said, since our nation's founding, the quintessential idea in America has been nurtured and enriched and advanced by the contributions and sacrifices of so many people -- almost all of whom were immigrants. Native Americans were, in fact, the only people who were here -- only people who were here.
And so, folks, you know, it's dreams of immigrants like you that built America and continue to inject new energy, new vitality, new -- new strength. We've seen that most clearly during this pandemic, with immigrants as frontline workers and as scientists and researchers on the frontlines of finding vaccines.
Another defining moment of our nation in the past year was NASA landing Perseverance Rover on Mars, flying the Ingenuity helicopter above its surface as I talked to them -- what is considered a sort of outer-space Wright brothers moment.
I spoke to the team about this historic mission while it was underway, which includes immigrants. The team was made up of immigrants who told me they grew up looking at the stars -- literally, not a joke; I'm not making this up. That's what they told me in our conversation. Looking at the stars and believing only America could take them there. Well -- and we see it each and every single day.
Folks, among you are six members of the United States military. I ask you all to please stand. Thank you, thank you, thank you for service (inaudible). (Applause.) Thank you.
Folks -- please sit. Please sit down.
I was telling our new citizens, in the other room before we came in, that one of my most -- I don't know how to say it -- fulfilling moments was, as Vice President, when I went over to Saddam Hussein's god-awful, gaudy palace. And there were, I think, 167 men and women in uniform standing in that palace. As my wife who -- I think, I'm not sure of this -- may be the only First Lady or Second Lady to go into a warzone -- an active war zone. She was with me, and we both stood there as I was able to swear in every one of those military officers as U.S. citizens.
And I thought to myself -- I thought to myself, ""What incredible justification for all the things that Saddam didn't believe in."" And they stood -- and there were a number there who had won Silver Stars -- not -- like you, not citizens when you join -- won Silver Stars, Bronze Stars, Conspicuous Service Medals, Purple Hearts. And I got to swear them in in the palace of a dictator.
Also among this incredible group that's here are healthcare workers and frontline workers who went above and beyond the call in the fight against COVID-19. They did so in hospitals and clinics, at our National Institute of Health -- the NIH -- at restaurants and retailers, as educators also in our schools. I want to thank you all for risking your lives to help others keep their country and our country going.
And joining you today are your families. And I want you to know and understand that this is your day as well. I can only imagine the pride you must feel. Pride in where you come from, in who you are, in the lives you've built together as America -- in America, and the communities that make you stronger, make us stronger.
All of you represent how immigration has always been essential to America. We're constantly renewing ourselves. Constantly. When we come out of this pandemic and build an economy, we're going to build it back better. If we're going to do that, we need to fix our immigration system and fully tap the talent and dynamism in our nation.
I've kept my commitment and sent an immigration reform bill to the United States Congress. It includes smart border management and security and a pathway to citizenship for 11 million undocumented people in America.
With Vice President Harris's leadership, we're getting at the root causes of why people are migrating for our southern border from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador in the first place: the violence; the corruption; the gangs; the political instability; the hungry -- the natural -- the hunger; the natural disasters.
And I've made it clear that we can work together on other critical issues as well: a pathway to citizenship for DREAMers -- the young people who have only known America as their home; a pathway for immigrants who are here on temporary protective status -- TPS -- who came from countries beset by manmade and natural-made violence and disaster; and a pathway for farmworkers who are here putting food on our tables but are not citizens.
Folks, in the competition for the 21st century, we need an immigration system that both reflects our values and upholds our laws. We can do both.
I'll close with this: No matter where you come from or the culture that has made us, the language we speak, or the faith we follow, one of the most basic acts of respect is inviting others into your home.
You know, as we close out Immigration Heritage Month and start our nation's Fourth of July weekend, I can think of no better way to honor each occasion than by welcoming all of you into the White House -- the People's House -- I might add, designed by an Irishman -- (laughter) -- for real -- in a nation shaped by the immigrant's heart.
I look forward to standing with you as you embrace your new rights and responsibilities as American citizens, and as generations have done before you.
So, welcome, my fellow Americans.
Now, before we take the Pledge of Allegiance together,
I'd like to invite one guest, Sandra Lindsay, to please come up onstage. (Applause.)
Sandra immigrated to Queens, New York, from Jamaica when she was 18 years old. And over the past -- I don't believe this -- 30 years -- she doesn't look 30 years old -- (laughter) -- she's pursued her dream of becoming a nurse to allow her to do what she wanted to do most: give back to her new country.
She earned a bachelor's degree, then a master's degree, then a doctorate degree, and her citizenship. And now she's Director of Nursing for Critical Care at a hospital on Long Island.
And during the height of the pandemic, she poured her heart and soul into her work to help patients fight for their lives and to keep her fellow nurses safe.
With a grandson at home -- prematurely -- she did what she had to do: She kept her distance and kept him safe. He is safe, but she lost an aunt and an uncle to the virus.
But in her pain, she didn't lose hope. When the time came, she was the first person in America to get fully vaccinated outside of clinical trials. She can now hug her grandson. She's out there making sure her patients and folks in her community are getting vaccinated so they can get back to their lives and their loved ones.
Sandra, if there are any angels in Heaven -- as I told you, having spent a lot of time in the ICU -- they're all nurses, male and female. Doctors let you live; nurses make you want to live. Make you want to live -- for real.
Sandra's vaccination card and hospital scrubs and the badge that was -- she wore will be included in the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History exhibit on COVID-19. (Applause.)
And today, she's receiving the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services' Outstanding Americans by Choice Recognition, which recognizes the naturalized citizens who have made significant contributions to our country through civic participation, professional achievement, and responsible citizenship.
Sandra, thank you for representing the very best of all of us. Thank you all in this room. Thank you, again. This is America.
Happy Fourth of July. May God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you. (Applause.)

Remarks Honoring the 2020 World Series Champion Los Angeles Dodgers
","
THE PRESIDENT: Well, good afternoon, everyone. It's a great beginning of the Fourth of July weekend. Madam Vice President. Mr. Leader, how are you? Good to see you.
We're here today to congratulate a group of folks who did pretty well. Welcome to the White House. I have a feeling, Kamala, I think we may be doing this again by the end of the year. (Laughter.) I don't know, man. I'm not sure I'll be able to handle Garcetti if you win twice. (Laughter.) I mean, it's going to be hard -- really hard.
But the 2020 World Series Champions, the Los Angeles Dodgers, are here. (Applause.) We are honored and thrilled they're here.
And that goes for the Vice President, too. She's from California, you probably heard. I'm not going to mention which end of the state she's from right now -- (laughter) -- and who she roots for, but -- is Doug here?
THE VICE PRESIDENT: He was with them last night.
THE PRESIDENT: I know he was. I thought he may --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Came home wearing his jersey. (Laughter.)
THE PRESIDENT: I tell you what -- well, you know, we have -- you know, when you talk about mixed families, I got a mixed family and she's got a mixed family, based on baseball -- (laughter) -- and sports. I'm not going to mention that team in northern California, in the San Francisco area. And I'm not going to mention that team in Philadelphia. (Laughter.) My wife is a Philly girl from her belt buckle to her shoe soles. And if -- if I root for anybody but the Phillies, I'll be sleeping in the Lincoln Bedroom alone. (Laughter.) But it's, you know, sometimes -- well, no, never. But at any rate --
But the Dodgers are a lot more than a baseball club. They really are. They're a pillar of American culture and American progress. And that's for real.
The team that brought us the voice of Vin Scully and Sandy -- the arm of Sandy Koufax and Fernando Valenzuela -- and I was talking with staff and they said, ""I want to teach you how to pronounce that name."" I said, ""I watched him pitch."" (Laughter.) But I'm only 37. (Laughter.) But it's -- I wish -- anyway, above all else, the heart of Jackie Robinson.
Now, you're building a new dynasty for a new generation. And I've often said that it's never a good idea to bet against the American people; I tell that to every world leader I encounter.
Well, now we know it's never a good idea to bet against Mookie. And Mookie is a hell of a ballplayer, but -- and a guy who used to love Mookie is my Chief Strategist, Mike Donilon. But he doesn't want to talk to Mookie anymore. (Laughter.) Mookie left Boston, and this is a Boston fan. I mean, you know, there's nothing like dividing staffs based on baseball.
But, folks, it's not a good idea to bet against Clayton either, you know, or Cody.
You know, this is -- this is a world championship organization because they've got a team full of guys who stepped up when they were called upon. Just stepped up.
And it takes a team to finish with the best record in baseball -- to knock out the Brewers, the Padres, the Braves, the Rays -- and win it all. And the Dodgers just didn't win. You finished with the highest winning percentage of any team since 1954. (Applause.) Think about that: the winningest ball club since 1954.
You know, it takes a team to persevere through one of the most challenging seasons and one of the most challenging years
in our nation's history.
In the pandemic, when it struck, it upended just about everything -- every part of American life. Families were grieving for loved ones lost. The economy collapsed. And the pain and fear in the nation were immeasurable.
And when the season began, it was easy to feel like it was -- they had bigger things to worry about than just sports. And, of course, we did and we still do. But I think what we discovered is that we need sports more than we ever realized. We s- -- we see it now as fans return to ballparks and arenas all across the country, cheering on their favorite players and teams, sharing that sense of community and pride. It's a uniting feature, as I said to you guys in the other room.
And when we go through a crisis, very often sports brings us together to heal, to help us feel like things are going to be okay, they're going to get better. For a few hours each day, feeling and sensing and experiencing something familiar, something normal, something that's fun in the middle of the chaos, and believing that we're going to get back to all that we're missing and we're going to get back to it someday soon.
So today, we celebrate your incredible achievement. We celebrate the great work you do on and off the field, in the community, and on childhood literacy, preventing bullying, and so much more.
For the way this team is built and from the way it's built, I suspect we have -- we have many of you, as I said, maybe back visiting soon.
Above all, as we beat this pandemic and celebrate fans coming back to stadiums, we celebrate something else: a national achievement. We came together, as fellow Americans -- frontline workers, friends, families, neighbors -- looking out for one another. And Dodger Stadium was the heart of that effort -- I want to thank the ownership for that -- the heart of the effort, administering more than 1 million COVID tests at the stadium and getting nearly a half million vaccine doses in people's arms.
Dodgers also helped us come together by being the first team in baseball to make their stadium available to voting -- as distanced, outdoor vote centers during the last election.
So not only does Dodger Stadium hosts world champions, it helped save lives and strengthen our democracy as well.
Together, as a nation, we have proved that it truly is never a good bet to bet against America. America is back, and the Dodgers are back.
So, congratulations to all of you and the best of luck the rest of the season. May God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Thank you. (Applause.)
Now -- now let's bring up a three-time Cy Young Award winner, Clayton Kershaw, to say a few words and maybe throw a few curveballs. (Laughter.) Okay. Come on up, man. (Applause.)
MR. KERSHAW: Hi, everybody. First time to speak at the White House, so sorry if I'm a little nervous. (Laughter.) But, Mr. President, thank you for having us. It's an honor to be here and get to celebrate our World Series victory here at the White House.
Last season was a special one for us, but it was also a challenging one for our country. And our hope was that we were able to provide just a little bit of joy and comfort and relief to our fans that were going through some tough times.
This season, it's been incredible to have fans back in the ballpark. We missed their energy and their passion for the game. And it means so much to us that people are coming back to the ballpark and things around the country are going back to normal. Hopefully, like you said, we can come visit again next year.
So, with that, we brought something for you and the Vice President. And now our team owner, Mark Walter, is going to bring that down for you.
(The President is presented with a Dodgers jersey.) (Applause.)
THE PRESIDENT: I have to show you I'm a man of courage. (Laughter.)
Well, thank you very much. What a -- what a lovely -- what a great honor. Thank you.
MR. KERSHAW: I think Doc is going to come up now and present to Madam Vice President. (Applause.)
(The Vice President is presented with a Dodgers jersey.) (Applause.)
MR. ROBERTS: Madam Vice President, this is your jersey.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: I needed it. (Laughter.) (Applause.) Thank you all. Thank you. Thanks, guys.
MR. ROBERTS: That blue looks very good on you. (Laughter.)
THE PRESIDENT: Hold it up.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: There you go.
THE PRESIDENT: All right. Okay.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
MR. KERSHAW: Thank you so much for having us.
THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, man.
MR. KERSHAW: Appreciate it. Thank you. (Laughter.)
THE PRESIDENT: All right. You're going to take this down, I know, in a minute, but hang on a second.
Folks, you know, I think even the Americans who aren't baseball fans, they -- there's an awful lot of baseball metaphors and an awful lot that we -- we -- it creeps into every part of our language and our culture. And it has been one of the great equalizers.
What -- come on up here, Madam Vice President. What the Vice President and I have spent a lot of time working on making sure we do is deal with the equity in the United States.
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
THE PRESIDENT: Making sure that we change the dynamic in a fundamental way. That, you know, we are the only nation in the world based -- organized, based on an idea. Ever na- -- every other nation is based on a notion of culture or geography or religion. We're the only one based on an idea. Not a joke.
And the idea is, ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men [and women] are created equal… endowed by their Creator."" That's who we are. And we decided this is a time to push that forward.
Look what baseball has done. Look what baseball has done. Look at -- look -- the makeup of this ballclub and the makeup of the ballclubs all across the league. I really mean that. It's gigantic. Look at who's managing this club. You know, I mean, it's -- so it matters. And you send a message that is profound.
Now I'm going to mention one ballplayer that the Vice President heard me mentioned before, that I -- even I never -- and I -- even I'm not old enough to have watched him play -- but Satchel Paige.
And Satchel Paige, as any pitcher out here can tell you -- the older you get, the harder to keep that arm going. Right? Well, he didn't get to the majors until he was 45 years old. On his 47th birthday -- I know you all know this -- he pitched a win against Chicago. And all the press went into his room, and -- in the locker room, and said, ""Satch, Satch, it's amazing: 47 years old and you pitched a win. How do you feel about being 47, Satch?"" He said, ""Boys, that's not how I look at age."" I had the staff look this up. This is what he did say: ""That's not how I look at age."" ""Then how do you look at it, Satch?"" ""I look at this way"" -- he said, ""How old would you be if you didn't know how old you were?"" (Laughter.) I am 51 years old. (Laughter.) You guys are 19. (Laughter.)
Anyway, I think you real- -- I know you don't underestimate it anymore. You saw what happened in other professional leagues and the way you and all the leagues responded to the crisis we faced. So thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
And I -- I just want you to know that there -- we have a congressional baseball game every year. In the very beginning, I used to be a centerfielder and my Walter Mitty dream -- anyways, it's a long story, but -- (laughter) --
And my kids only remember two things that ever happened to me in my career -- my boys. And they've met kings and queens, they've gone to other countries. But I played, when the first -- the second congressional baseball game at the old stadium -- the old Washington stadium. And I hit one off the right-centerfield wall. It bounced off the wall. I think it's 368 or -- I don't know what is exactly now -- but off the wall. And I'm rounding -- anyway, to make a long story short, my kids remember that, all the rest. And guess what? The only thing I remember, too. (Laughter.) Here I thought: What could have been. What could have been.
But at any rate. And I'm with Cedric Richmond, who is a congressman, a hell of an athlete, pitched in college. And he -- we're both hoping that somehow -- he would do it based on merit; I'm hoping that because I got elected President, I may do it on influence -- to be invi- -- (laughter) -- to be inducted into the -- the Congressional Baseball Hall of Fame. (Laughter.) You all think I'm kidding, don't you? (Laughter.) No.
Anyway, so thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And I just want you to know, it really means a lot to us that you're here. It means a lot that -- and the kind of hope you give the American people. Don't underestimate it, guys. Don't underestimate it.

Remarks on the June Jobs Report and an Exchange with Reporters
","
THE PRESIDENT: Good morning, everyone. It is a good morning. (Laughs.) It's a good morning. As we get prepared to celebrate Independence Day, today's job news brought us something else to celebrate. This morning we learned that, in June, our economy created 850,000 jobs. Eight hundred and fifty thousand jobs. Wages went up for American workers.
Since I took office, our recovery [economy] has created an average of 600,000 dollar -- six- -- ""dollars."" (Laughs.) I wish they -- they probably wish there was 600,000 jobs that paid $600,000 a year. But 600,000 jobs per month. We have now created over 3 million jobs since I took office -- more jobs than have ever been created in the first five months of any presidency in modern history, thanks to the incredible work of the entire team.
This is historic progress pulling our economy out of the worst crisis in 100 years, driven in part by our dramatic progress in vaccinating our nation and beating back the pandemic, as well as other elements of the American Rescue Plan.
Today, the U.S. is the only major advanced economy where the OECD projections of future output are higher today than they were in January 2020, before the pandemic hit. And America was ranked first in Bloomberg's ""COVID Resilience Ranking."" None of this happened by accident. Again, it's a direct result of the American Rescue Plan. And at the time, people questioned whether or not we should do that, even though we didn't have bipartisan support. Well, it worked.
In February, the Congressional Budget Office projected 2021 economic growth would be 3.7 percent. Yesterday, they doubled that number to 7.4 percent, in large part thanks to the American Rescue Plan and our work to defeat the virus.
The last time the economy grew at this rate was in 1984, and Ronald Reagan was telling us it's ""morning in America."" Well, it's getting close to afternoon here. The sun is coming out. At the time, the CBO revised their long-run deficit projections down as a share of GDP they -- just as they have done.
So, the American Rescue Plan is strengthening our financial position, and it grows our economy. It's continuing to grow our economy. And the strength of our recovery is helping us flip the script.
Instead of workers competing with each other for jobs that are scarce, employers are competing with each other to attract workers. That kind of competition in the market doesn't just give workers more ability to earn higher wages; it also gives them the power to demand to be treated with dignity and respect in the workplace.
More jobs, better wages -- that's a good combination. Put simply: Our economy is on the move, and we have COVID-19 on the run.
Yes, we have more work to do to get America vaccinated and everyone back to work. We are aiming for full employment, and that means keeping our pace on job growth, including for Black, Hispanic, and Asian workers.
But this progress is testament to our commitment to grow this economy from the bottom up and the middle out. The American Rescue Plan provided resources to get shots in people's arms and checks in people's pockets. Schools -- schools were struggling to reopen so we made vaccinating teachers a priority, getting schools much-needed support.
In March, we've added -- just in the month of [since] March, we added 364,000 education jobs and roles. Small businesses and restaurants were getting crushed. Now we're delivering the loans and support they need to reopen and to stay open.
This morning, we've learned that jobs in some hard-hit sectors -- such as restaurants, hotels, amusement parks -- were up by 343,000 last month; over 1.5 million over the past five months. And more help is on the way to give families just a little bit more breathing room.
Starting this month, families are going to receiving one of the largest-ever, single-year tax cuts that middle-class families have ever received, and it's called the Child Care Tax Credit.
And here's how it works: In the past, if you paid taxes and had a good income, you could deduct $2,000 per child, and that would come off the total amount of taxes you owe. If you had two children, you owed $10,000; you take off $4,000.
In the American Rescue Plan, we expanded that. Now a parent would get $3,600 for each child under the age of six, and $3,000 for dependents they had between the ages of 6 and 17. So instead of just being a credit against your taxes you owe, it's now a fully refundable credit, half of which will get paid out in monthly basis.
Look, what that means is: This year, middle-class families with two young children can expect to get -- receive $7,200 in a rebate, in effect -- a tax return -- with the monthly payments of $600 a month starting this month, until it's paid out.
Eight out of every ten families who use direct deposit will get their refunds. They'll be able to get a monthly payment on the 15th of every month from now until the end of the year, so they get that paid out. Help with families most need it -- most need help to make ends meet. It's important.
And I've said it for a long time: It's time to give ordinary folks, ordinary Americans, middle-class and working-class Americans a tax break. This is the type of tax cut that can help our economy because it will go to families who are going to spend it.
It will also help lead a historic reduction in child poverty -- excuse me -- (the President takes a drink of water) -- historic reduction in child poverty, which would have long-term benefits for our economy.
And we're delivering $39 billion to help childcare providers serve more families, to help parents, particularly women, get back to work.
Last month, our economy added nearly 25,000 childcare jobs. Again, none of this happened by accident. We're providing -- proving to the naysayers and the doubters that they were wrong.
None of this is guaranteed to continue, though, unless we finish our work. Now is the time to accelerate the progress we've been making. Now is the time to build in a long-term foundation that we've laid, and build it in for a long term. Economists of all stripes agree that my plan will create good jobs and drastically strengthen our economy in the long run.
So we have to continue to make the investments that will allow our economy to build back better and deal everyone in. We took a significant step in that direction last week when the bipartisan group of senators forged an agreement with me to move forward on key portions of my American Jobs Plan.
It was -- I just in Wisconsin, where I highlighted how this agreement is going to pave the way for a generational investment to modernize our infrastructure; create millions of jobs, according to the experts; and what that will mean an ever- -- and it won't just be in the center cities. It will be every corner of the state and our nation.
We're going to create jobs repairing roads and bridges, replacing 100 percent of our nation's lead water pipes, making our power grid more reliable, delivering high-speed Internet to every American home, rural and urban.
We're going to put people to work building a nationwide electric vehicle charging network, transitioning from diesel school buses and transit buses to electric buses, and bringing in world-class rail service to more Americans by reducing -- and, in the process, reduce our carbon footprint.
For example, when I was up in Wisconsin, I said -- I pointed out -- the governor was there. I said, ""Gov, I know it takes…"" -- or I don't know how many people -- a couple hundred people, I guess, in the audience. I said, ""It takes, they tell me, four and half hours to drive from here to Chicago. With the money we have in -- for mass transit here, we -- you're going to be able to do that in two and half hours."" And all the data shows that when it's easier to get someplace by rail than by automobile, it's cheaper and it generates a whole lot less carbon footprint.
We're going to create good-paying union jobs capping hundreds of thousands of abandoned oil and gas wells to stop methane leaks, which are devastating, and to protect the health of our communities. These are good jobs.
Taken together, these investments are going to position America to compete with the world and win the 21st century.
You know, as we bring home key parts of my American Jobs Plan, I'm going to make the case for equally critical investments that we still need, including those in which I introduced at the same time: my American Families Plan.
When I was running for President, I put together a bold, aggressive plan to deliver childcare, paid leave, universal pre-K for three- and four-year-olds, free community college. Maybe the most important among them was extending the expanded Child Care Tax Credit I just mentioned for another five years, which will significantly benefit middle-class and working-class families.
That human infrastructure is as essential as our physical infrastructure. It's going to help us create more good jobs, ease the burden on working families, and strengthen our economy -- strengthen it in the long run.
These investments are critical. And as the plans I put forward tackle our climate crisis, which are broad and deep, I'm going to fight to see them enacted and signed into law. We have a chance to seize this economic momentum of the first months of my administration, not just to build back, but as I've been saying, ""build back better.""
This is much already -- this much is already clear: We're on the right track and we're on the right track. Our plan is working. And we're not going to let up now.
So I want to thank everyone. I wish you all a happy Fourth of July. We're going to be able to go to ballgames. You're going to be able to sit in the stadiums. You're going to be able to be with your families in backyard barbeques, as we hoped. And we're going to make more progress.
So, God bless America. And may God protect our troops.
Q: Could you talk to us about Afghanistan? Is the drawdown going to be done in the next few days?
THE PRESIDENT: No.
Q: No?
THE PRESIDENT: No, we're on -- we're on track exactly as to where we expected to be. But we just -- I wanted to make sure there was enough, quote, ""running room"" that we could get -- wouldn't be able to do it all until September. There will still be some forces left. But it's a rational drawdown with our allies, and it's making -- so there's nothing unusual about it.
Q: Are you worried that the Afghan government might fall? I mean, we are hearing about how the Taliban is taking more and more districts.
THE PRESIDENT: Look, we were in that war for 20 years. Twenty years. And I think -- I met with the Afghan government here in the White House, in the Oval. I think they have the capacity to be able to sustain the government. There are going to have to be, down the road, more negotiations, I suspect. But I am -- I am concerned that they deal with the internal issues that they have to be able to generate the kind of support they need nationwide to maintain the government.
Q: A follow on that thought on Afghanistan --
THE PRESIDENT: I want to talk about happy things, man.
Q: If there is evidence that Kabul is threatened, which some of the intelligence reports have suggested it could be in six months or thereabout, do you think you've got the capability to help provide any kind of air support, military support to them to keep the capital safe, even if the U.S. troops are obviously fully out by that time?
THE PRESIDENT: We have worked out an over-the-horizon capacity that we can be value added, but the Afghans are going to have to be able to do it themselves with the Air Force they have, which we're helping them maintain.
Q: Sir, on Afghanistan --
THE PRESIDENT: I'm not going to answer any more quick question on Afghanistan.
Q: Are you concerned --
THE PRESIDENT: Look, it's Fourth of July.
Q: On the economy --
Q: Are you concerned about Fourth of July gatherings --
THE PRESIDENT: I'm concerned that you guys are asking me questions that I'll answer next week. But I'm -- this is a holiday weekend. I'm going to celebrate it. There is great things happening.
The economy is growing faster than any time in 40 years. We've got a record number of new jobs. COVID deaths are down 90 percent. Wages are up faster than any time in 15 years. We're bringing out -- bringing our troops home. We have -- all across America, people are going to ballgames and doing good things. This is good.
I'll be -- I'll answer all your negative questions -- not negative -- your legitimate question.
Q: But with the gatherings, are you concerned that there is a potential, this weekend, in places where vaccination levels are not particularly high, that there will be new COVID outbreaks in various regions of the country?
THE PRESIDENT: I am concerned that people who have not gotten vaccinated have the capacity to catch the variant and spread the variant to other people who have not been vaccinated.
I am not concerned there is going to be a major outbreak -- in other words, that we're going to have another epidemic nationwide, but I am concerned lives will be lost. And I was even reading today there's some speculation and some judgment that's coming out that you may be able to even communicate the vaccine -- the -- the new variant to your pets.
So I say, not -- not totally facetiously, for those of you who haven't been vaccinated because you don't -- you don't -- you don't think it's -- you want to go through it: It doesn't hurt, it's accessible, it's free, it's available. And not only -- don't think about yourself; think about your family. Think about those around you. That's what we should be thinking about today.
The Fourth of July this year is different than the Fourth of July last year. And it's going to be better next year.
Thank you all.
Q: Mr. President, do you think that Congress will enact your plans? Are you confident --
THE PRESIDENT: Yes.
Q: -- that you're going to get it done?
THE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.)
Q: Come on.
THE PRESIDENT: Come on, guys. Am I co- -- are you -- have you ever been confident about anything with guarantee? Who wants to put money on anything that Congress is going to do? Look, folks, this is a process. This is a process.
I love you guys, but it's a process. And I don't -- you want me to say, ""Yes, I'm absolutely certain."" Well, are you absolutely certain this new commission is going to work, investigating what happened on the 6th? Are you guys confident that Republicans are going to participate?
Look, all I know -- only thing I know what to do -- and I really mean this -- is do my best to lay out what I think the country has to do, try to be as persuasive as I can, and hope. And thus far, you know, it's -- you know, it seems to be working a little bit. So, thank you.

Remarks on the Surfside Residential Building Collapse and an Exchange With Reporters in Miami Beach, Florida
","
The President. Good afternoon, folks. Let me begin by saying that the degree of cooperation between local, State, and Federal officials down here has been remarkable.
I want to thank our FEMA Director for leading this national effort. But Governor DeSantis, Senators Rubio and Scott, Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, and Mayor Cava—Cava—they've been—they've all cooperated in ways that I haven't seen in a long time. And it's really a testament to what's—how difficult things are down here. And it's what, quite frankly, we miss a lot. You know, we all—we've all been working in tandem from the moment we got the news of the collapse of the building.
And I think my colleagues will tell you we cut through the bureaucracy. The one order I gave the Federal folks was: ""No bureaucracy. Just cut through it. Get to whatever they need."" That's why we've decided to cover, for example, 100 percent of the search-and-rescue costs for the first 30 days. Not done often, but necessary here, in my view.
And FEMA is going to provide temporary housing and other urgent needs for the survivors. The State Department is expediting visas for family members from other countries, and there are from Latin America, South America, Europe, Israel.
And I want to give a special shout-out to the first responders—International Association of Firefighters, one of the best organizations in the country. And I particularly want to thank the president. Ed came down from Boston, and he's here with the entire group.
You know, these folks are—these folks are always showing up, no matter what. They're risking their lives. You know, there's that old expression. I know, the press that travels with me is tired of hearing me saying it, but I'm not tired of saying it. And that is—that old expression—""God made man. Then, he made a few firefighters."" They're remarkable, remarkable people. There's always—they're always risking their lives to save lives, as well as the police and other first responders. I got to meet with a whole bunch of them.
And we are able to deploy nearly 500 personnel, including five other search-and-rescue teams on the ground today here because of—our FEMA Director ordered it. I want to compliment FEMA and, I might add, all those folks who are risking their lives to save lives, but also holding out hope that others will be found. Hope springs eternal.
When I talked to those first responders, I pointed out that they're under a great deal of stress and we should take advantage—they should take advantage of the mental health facilities that are going to be available. Because, you know, we talk about our military suffering from posttraumatic stress. Well, seeing what they're seeing and doing what they're doing, understanding how much trauma is involved, they—I just don't want them thinking that they should walk away from help if it's needed. You know, they stand together, and it's really impressive.
And there's also the need, in addition to State and local assistance, to determine the cause of this collapse and the adjacent buildings, how safe they are. There are two outstanding concerns. First, the remaining buildings may collapse—the remainder of the building may collapse. We need to determine if it's safe for first responders to return to the site to continue their rescue mission.
That's being done right now. And that's why I asked the National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST, to investigate, to see if it's safe to go back and what caused the building to collapse in the first place. Because we're committed not only to recover, but to restore the safety across the board.
But the other reason I came down was to meet with the families. The whole Nation is mourning with these families. They see it every day on television. They're going through hell. And those who survived the collapse, as well as those who are missing loved ones.
I realize I'm a little late because I spent a lot of time with the families—a whole lot of time. And I apologize for taking so long to get here, because I thought it was important to speak to every single person who wanted to speak to me. So, after what you all covered when I opened up the meeting, I spent the remainder of the time, and I—and such incredible people.
I sat with one woman who had just lost her husband and her little baby boy; didn't know what to do. I sat with another family that lost almost the entire family: cousins, brothers, sisters. And to watch them and to—they're praying and pleading that: ""God, let there be a miracle. Let them be something happen for me that's good.""
Because I have, like many of you do, some idea what it's like to suffer that kind of loss so many of them are suffering. You know, they had basic heart-wrenching questions: ""Will I be able to recover the body of my son or daughter, my husband, my cousin, my mom and dad? How can I have closure without being able to bury them if I don't get the body? What do I do?""
Jill and I wanted them to know that we're with them and the country is with them. Our message today is that we're here for you, as one Nation—as one Nation. And that's the message we communicated. We'll be in touch with a lot of these families continuing through this process. But there is much more to be done. We're ready to do it.
And again, I thank the Governor, I thank my colleagues, my—Senator Scott and Senator Rubio, I thank Debbie Wasserman Schultz for their total, complete cooperation. There's no—there's no disagreement, no bickering. Everybody is on the same team. It's what America is all about. It's about pulling together, leaving nobody behind. And that's what made me feel—the one thing that made me feel good about this is the—is a cohesion that exists. There's no Democrat or Republican out there; they're just people wanting to do the right thing for their fellow Americans.
So may God bless the victims and their families, and may God protect our first responders.
And I'll take a couple questions right now.
Search-and-Rescue Efforts at the Champlain Towers South Condominium Building in Surfside, Florida 
Q. Mr. President, what were you told today about the likelihood—you said, ""Hope springs eternal""—but that somebody will be able to be pulled out alive from this? And what were you able to convey to the families about that possibility?
The President. Well, look, first of all, the families are very realistic. They know the longer it goes—and one of the things that the local FEMA personnel as well as the local first responders did is, they took all of the families to the site to see: to see what it looked like up close. And they're all realists. They all look, and they see those floors just literally feet—cement upon cement upon cement.
You know, I—when I talked to some of the families, some of the people who did escape, survived, got out, they talked about watching the building collapse and watching as they were in the garage—one floor come down—literally a whole floor on top of another floor. They know that the chances are, as each day goes by, diminished slightly.
But at a minimum—at a minimum—they want to recover the bodies. They want to recover the bodies. There's a lot of very religious people who are in there. Members of the—the rabbis in the Jewish community were talking about the need to make sure that they recover the body and be able to bury them. Give them—and you know, the—anyway.
So I think they're very realistic, Mike [Mike Memoli, NBC News]. But I don't think that that, in any way, suggests that it's too—that we should stop. I think that we should move on, continue to try to recover the bodies.
In the meantime, that's why NIST and others are determining whether or not it's safe to send the first responders back. When they'd asked me about this, I'd point out that the last thing they would want and we would want is, in the process of trying to recover—and the possibility—there's still a possibility someone could be alive, someone could still be breathing, someone could be there—that the last thing you want to have happen is have that building collapse and kill 10, 20, 30, 50 firefighters or wound them, or first responders.
So—but Mike, they're—you know, they're realistic. I—it just brought back so many—so many memories. It's bad enough—it's bad enough—to lose somebody. But the hard part—the really hard part—is to not know whether they're surviving or not, just not have any idea.
When the accident took my wife and my family, the hardest part was: Were my boys going to get out? Are they going to make it? And not knowing. Not knowing, when you're flying home from Washington to get the news. You know, you just don't know. So it's—but I was amazed—as you know, unfortunately, I've done a lot of these circumstances where I've met with families who have had great loss. And what amazed me about this group of people was the resilience and their absolute commitment, their willingness to do whatever it took to find—to find an answer. I walked away impressed by their strength.
And—and Nancy [Nancy Cook], Bloomberg, do you have a question?
Q. Yes——
The President. I was told.
Collapse of the Champlain Towers South Condominium Building in Surfside, Florida/Climate Change and Rising Sea Levels 
Q. Oh, thank you. Yes. What did you learn, if anything, about the collapse of the building? Is there anything more you learned from investigators or the FEMA Administrators today?
The President. No, it's underway. I don't—and the Director of FEMA is with me here. We don't have any firm proof of what's happened. There's all kinds of rational speculation about whether or not the rebars are—were rusted; whether or not the cement—whether it was limestone or not; whether or not—but a lot of the families who survived talked about how upset they were that, in the last years that they've been here, how there was one condominium complex built across the street, and a road was purchased. And while they were living there, they would hear the drilling, and they'd feel their building moving and shaking.
There are all kinds of discussions about whether or not they thought that water level rising—what impact it had. And interesting to me—I didn't raise it—but how many of the survivors and how many of the families talked about the impact of global warming. How much—and they didn't know exactly, but they talked about sea levels rising and about how there were—and—and the combination of that and the concern about incoming storms—incoming tropical storms.
And so—but I don't think there is, at this point, any definitive judgment as to why it collapsed and what can be done to prevent it from happening and what other buildings may have to be inspected to determine if they have the same problems.
I'm supposed to head out and catch up with the Governor. So I want to thank you all for taking the time.
Manhattan District Attorney's Investigation of the Trump Organization/Supreme Court Decision Upholding Arizona State Voting Restrictions/Voting Rights Protections 
Q. Mr. President, can we ask you about two matters away from where we are now? The first is: While you've been speaking, a top associate of the former President has been in a New York court, pleading not guilty to various financial charges. Do you have a reaction to that?
And secondarily, if I can, does the Supreme Court's ruling today on an important voting rights decision add to the sense of urgency you feel about pursuing voting rights legislation at this time?
The President. I know nothing about the first circumstance because I've been gone. I don't have any idea, so I'm not going to comment on that. And even if I did, I wouldn't comment on an ongoing case if it's an ongoing case.
With regard to the second point: I think I did get a summary on the way down on the plane of the Supreme Court decision. It is mildly positive, in the sense that there's a remedy available based on the particular voting decision.
I think that it is critical that we make a distinction between voter suppression and suspension. The ability of a State legislative body to come along and vote—their legislature—vote to change who is declared the winner, I find to be somewhat astounding.
But the Supreme Court rule did not rule that way today, to the best of my knowledge. And—but I'll have much more to say about that, because I plan on speaking extensively on voting rights and—as well as going on the road on this issue.
So thank you all very much.

Remarks Prior to a Briefing on the Surfside Residential Building Collapse in Miami Beach, Florida
","
[The President's remarks were joined in progress.] 
The President. ——and I've got to say that, you know, having been to, unfortunately, a lot of—like many of us have—a lot of disaster sites because of natural disasters, it's—what you're doing, in coordination among you all, has been just admirable. It really is impressive.
And so I just want to say thanks and listen and find out what I can do as President and what I can unleash, in terms of help, for whatever you need.
The Governor and the mayor have been completely open with me, asked whatever they—whatever they've asked, I think we've been able to deliver. And I think there's more that we can do, including—I think I have the power—and we'll know shortly that—to be able to pick up a hundred percent of the cost for the county and the State for 30 days.
Mayor Daniella Levine Cava of Miami-Dade, Florida. Oh, my goodness, Mr. President.
The President. I think I'm quite sure I can do that. And so we're going to do that.
And there's going to be a lot—you all know it because a lot of you have been through it as well—there's going to be a lot of pain and anxiety and suffering and even need for psychological help in the days and months that follow.
And so we're not going anywhere.
Mayor Levine Cava. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President.
The President. No, for real. But, again, I just want to, you know, start the day, if I could, but getting as thorough briefing as you're able to give me, and tell me what you need. And that goes for both the Senators and the Congresswoman and anyone in Florida, just to pick up the phone to the Oval. For real. I'm not joking about it.
And I think the Gov will tell you—anything you ask for, we got. And we have another group of teams coming from FEMA today. How many people will it be?
Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Deanne Bennett Criswell. At the end of the day, there should about 500 on the ground.
The President. Five hundred on the ground.
So, again, this is your show. We just want to make sure that whatever you need—and you know, including—well, anyway, I'm talking too much. Why don't I—I want to hear from you guys.
Mayor Levine Cava. All right. Well, Mr. President, we cannot thank you enough for being here with us, for showing your extraordinary support from day one. You called me that morning. We hustled into a little room in the Family Reunification Center so I could take the call, and you said whatever we need. And I said, ""Bring FEMA,"" and here they are, on the ground.
[At this point, Mayor Levine Cava continued her remarks, concluding as follows.]
So I—we have a briefing for you. And I want to start with our Governor. And I want to thank you, Governor DeSantis. Your team has been amazing, but you personally have been amazing. You've been a steady, calming, reassuring, but forceful voice every step of the way. And it's been a pleasure to partner with you, truly. Thank you. Thank you.
Governor Ronald D. DeSantis of Florida. Well, if I could——
The President. Let me say just one more thing. You know what's good about this—the way you've cooperated? We're letting the Nation know we can cooperate.
Mayor Levine Cava. Yes, sir. That's right.
The President. And when it's really important——
Mayor Levine Cava. That's right.
The President. ——when it's really important—I was talking to Debbie about it on the way down—we come together. This is life and death.
And so I don't think—I just got back from about 12 days in Europe. They wonder whether we can do this. And you're doing it. I mean, just the simple act of everybody doing whatever needs to be done is a—and it really makes a difference, Gov.
Gov. DeSantis. Well, thank you, Mr. President. And you've recognized the severity of this tragedy from day one. And you've been very supportive.
We, in Florida—you know, you'll drive up and down these coastal roads, you'll see these buildings. And I've driven by that building, probably never thought twice. And then, something like this happens, and you recognize in each individual unit there's an amazing story.
And lives have been shattered irrevocably as a result of this. We've already identified, unfortunately, fatalities—people who've been 92 years old, have been a matriarch of a wonderful family. We have families with kids missing. And we even have young newlyweds who hadn't even been married a year who were in the tower when it collapsed.
And so the cooperation has been great. The local—both the municipal and the county have been fantastic. And you guys have not only been supportive at the Federal level, but we've had no bureaucracy. When we're dealing with FEMA, we're literally getting requests routed from local to State to Federal in no time——
The President. I promise you, there will be none.
Gov. DeSantis. ——and the approval is happening. Yes.
[Gov. DeSantis continued his remarks, concluding as follows.]
But I can tell you this: We're not going to stop until we identify everybody and until we do what we need to do. So thank you, Mr. President.
Mayor Levine Cava. Thank you, Mr. President. I want to acknowledge the leadership of the First Lady, Casey DeSantis, as well, who is very, very focused on children and mental health issues and is bringing that agenda to our discussions. And of course, we've been including all of that, as you'll learn from the briefings. But we know how important First Ladies are—[laughter]—so we just wanted to be sure to give a shout out.
[The press was escorted out, and the briefing continued.]

Remarks on Signing Legislation Regarding Methane Pollution, Predatory Lending, and Employment Discrimination
","
The President. Thank you. Madam Speaker, welcome to almost the other side. [Laughter] It's great to see you guys. And it's strange to have Congressmen stand up for me; that's an unusual thing to do. [Laughter] But thank you so much.
Well, welcome to the adjunct to the White House here. The—I'm about to sign into law three bills which you all have written and passed protecting our planet from climate-disturbing greenhouse gas, particularly methane, which is devastating; protecting consumers from predatory lenders; and protecting workers from employment discrimination. Each of these bills—each of these bills—reflects a return to common sense and commitment to the common good, and I want to thank every one of you for your leadership in getting this done.
The first bill is going to help us to drastically cut methane pollution. You may remember—and I know you all do, but to say this for the press and those listening, back when President Obama, in 2016, and I put in place a rule that required that companies capture methane leaks from the wells they were digging.
Well, guess what? They didn't. And so, since then, we've learned that methane is even more dangerous to the climate than we knew back then, in 2016—trapping much more heat—up to 80 times more heat, methane does—and carbon—than carbon dioxide in its first 20 years in the atmosphere.
And look, this is an important first step of cutting methane pollution. Our bipartisan infrastructure plan will include $21 billion in environmental remediation to capping millions of abandoned wells, leaking wells, and oil and gas wells. And so it will be a good step forward.
The second bill will protect borrowers against predatory lenders. In many States, these lenders are kept in check by caps on how much interest they can charge, but some loan sharks and online lenders have figured out how to get around these limits and—by using a partnership with a bank to avoid the State cap and charging outrageous interest. And I'm—you all have pointed out—some as high as 100-percent interest, which is astounding. And I must admit to you, I didn't know that. I was unaware they could do—pull that off.
These are so called ""rent-a-bank"" schemes. And they allow lenders to prey on veterans, seniors, and other unsuspecting borrowers tapping into—trapping them into a cycle of debt. And the last administration let it happened, but we won't.
And the third bill is going to help us hold employers accountable for workplace discrimination. As a nation, we continue to strive toward realizing our founding principle that all people are created equal and have a right to full access to the American Dream, and that includes at work—at work. That's why we have the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which enforces the law that makes job discrimination illegal.
The last administration put in place a rule that makes it harder—makes it harder—for those seeking redress for job discrimination to get justice. With this law, we're going to move in the direction of greater accountability, fairness, and justice.
[At this point, the President invited Members of Congress up to the signing desk and signed the bills.]

Remarks During a Meeting With Western Governors on Wildfire Prevention and Response Efforts
","
[The President's remarked were joined in progress.] 
The President. ——proud of our Cabinet. And they're all here today. They all want to be engaged. They all want to help. And so, hopefully, we're going to get into some exchanges going down the line here.
I want to thank you all again for being in the support meetings. So thank you, thank you, thank you. And, Governor Newsom, you trying to make us feel bad, listening in that magnificent background you have over there—[laughter]—and while I'm sitting in here in the White House? God love you. Anyway, it's good to see you all, really. Thank you.
For years, the President has received a briefing at the beginning of the hurricane season, looking at the trends that are coming to get a sense of what's coming so that the country can be better prepared.
And when I received that briefing this year, I asked for a second briefing that does the same thing, but now we're doing it about wildfire season. And we know this is becoming a regular cycle, and we know it's getting worse. In fact, the threat of western wildfires this year is as severe as it's ever been.
And I wanted to convene this group of Governors—of western State Governors, key members of my Cabinet, FEMA leadership, and the leadership from utility industries, and senior members of our White House team to make sure we're doing everything—and I mean this sincerely—we're doing everything possible to help you prepare for what's coming, and some is already there.
The truth is, we're playing catch up. This is an area that has been underresourced, but that's going to change, if we have anything to do with it. We can't cut corners when it comes to managing our wildfires or supporting our firefighters. And this briefing is going to be an annual event to make sure we're focusing on preventing fires—the fire threats in the first place—as well as responding when they arise.
But right now, we have to act and act fast. We're late in the game here. We're remembering the horrific scenes from last year: orange skies that looked like end of days; smoke and ash that made the air dangerous to breathe; more than 10 million acres burned; billions of dollars in economic damage; families that lost their homes and everything they own; and too many—too many—lost lives.
And this year, we—they could be even tougher, based on the weather patterns. You know, California and some other places, the drought conditions are twice that's—what they were last year. And right now, we're seeing record heat in Portland and across the West.
And this [last]* year, you know, 21 large, uncontained fires were burning. This year, there are 36 that are uncontained and burning. There are already about 9,000 firefighters deployed across the region—from California to New Mexico, to Utah and Nevada—and it's only June. I know—I realize I'm preaching to the choir here. I know you all know this better than any other people in the country.
Fire season, traditionally, lasts through October. But with climate change—climate change driving the dangerous confluence of extreme heat and prolonged drought—we're seeing wildfires in greater intensity that move with more speed, last—you know, and lasts well beyond traditional months—the traditional months of the fire season. And that's a problem for all of us.
Wildfires are not a partisan phenomenon. They don't stop at a county or a State line—or country line, for that matter. We need a coordinated, comprehensive response with all the Federal working—all the Federal Government working in close cooperation to support you, the States. That's what this is about. We want to know what you—the States and localities and Tribal governments and those in the frontlines—are facing in this danger and what you think would help the most.
Today we're taking critical steps to help protect American communities right away. First, we're going to make sure that we have enough firefighters on call who are trained, equipped, and ready to respond for all this fire season. And we're going to pay them. They—I mean, the idea these folks are running into—anyway, we should pay them.
Last week, I learned that some of our Federal firefighters are being paid less than $13 an hour. Come on, man. This is—that's unacceptable to me. And I immediately directed my team to take decisive action to fix it.
So today we're announcing what I still think is not enough: This year we're going to provide retention incentives that's going to ensure Federal wildland fires are—firefighters are making at least $15 an hour and provide for additional 10-percent bonuses for those working on the frontlines.
But a one-time boost is not enough. These courageous women and men take an incredible risk of running toward the fire, and they deserve to be paid and paid good wages. You know that old expression: ""God made man. Then, he made a few firefighters""? Well, it's true. They're incredible. I've spent a lot of time, my whole career, with them.
So we're going to work with Congress, and I know many of your Senators and Representatives have been working hard on this for—to permanently get Federal firefighters a better deal, including improvements in their compensation, their benefits, and their work-life balance.
The Federal Government is also offering funding, when Governors request it, to train and equip National Guard members so they have a—they're ready to provide a surge of firefighting capacity.
You know, one of the things I learned over the years, being so deeply involved with the firefighters, is the only thing that saves a firefighter's life is another firefighter. That's the single most consequential thing.
And you know, one of the hardest speeches I've ever had to make—and you've all—we've all made difficult speeches—was at the funeral of the 19 Granite Mountain Hotshot firefighters, when the Prescott, Arizona, Fire Department got clobbered. That tragedy happened 8 years ago today. That's the reason I mention it. It's hard to remember—of all the costs that firefighters risk when they do their job and their bravery to step up and do the job.
Now, traditionally, Federal firefighting has been a seasonal job, but because of climate change—and I know you all know it, and I hope your constituents know it: There is climate change—it's no longer a seasonal job. This is a year-round mission.
So we've made sure seasonal firefighters can stay on the job, as long as they are needed this year, by allowing them to work beyond their term. And for next year, we're working to make more than—of those positions, permanent positions so that when fires aren't burning, we have a workforce of experienced hands enhancing our forest management, reducing the risk of future fire in the future fire season.
Second thing: We are harnessing new tools and technologies to better identify and respond before new fires grow into large, uncontrolled conflagrations. So, for example, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, has satellite technology that is able to see from space when new fires start, while they're still small, even as small as the size of your dining room table.
Similarly, the Department of Energy has a sensor array computer analysis capability that can detect in real time the lightning strikes that might set off a blaze. And we're going to use those tools to identify fires that start in remote places and share that information so the firefighters on the ground can respond immediately before a fire has spread out of control. I know that's not a full answer, but it's real. It will improve things.
And we're also going to make sure that the people have a—the information to better protect themselves and their families from smoke and fire risks. This will include launching a new app on—from EPA, so individuals can easily access the latest information on air quality, smoke plumes, and public health guidance.
Third, we also have to make investments in our future. That's why the bipartisan infrastructure framework investment of about $50 billion in the—my so-called—anyway, I won't go into it. But a bill that's caused a little attention—infrastructure bill—is going to build resilience to extreme weather events like wildfires—$50 billion.
And today I'm announcing a $37 million Federal grant to Sonoma County, California, in support of fire mitigation efforts that are underway. This grant is part of FEMA's BRIC program, Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities. My administration doubled BRIC funding to support local efforts to strengthen resilience. And because Sonoma knows all too well the devastation wrought by fires, they were the first to apply for fire mitigation funding. I encourage more communities to do so next year.
And finally, I want to note that the extreme heat we're seeing in the West is not only a risk amplifier for wildfires, it's a threat in and of itself. People are hurting. It's more dangerous for kids to play outside. Roads are buckling under the heat. I need not—again, I need not tell all of you.
We need people to check on their neighbors, especially seniors who may need a helping hand; outdoor laborers, like our farm and construction workers, are going to need frequent water breaks and shade. I want to thank the Governors and local leaders for providing information to citizens and the resources like cooling centers where people can go to get relief from the heat.
And to our utility leaders: We are ready to work with you to make sure that people have the access to power, including air conditioning, under these extreme demand conditions while continuing to advance our climate goals.
Now, I'm eager to hear from each of you—each of the Governors—as to what the experience has been in your State and what we can do better to be helpful. Because this is an area where investing in prevention and preparation today is going to deliver invaluable returns tomorrow. And the Federal Government is going to have to do—have your backs. And that's going to—that's my intention.
I'll close by just saying thank you to everyone from the Forest Service, to the Department of Interior and Agriculture, to FEMA, to State and local and Tribal partners, and most importantly, our firefighters for all your incredible work. We've asked so much of the firefighters already, and I know you're going to continue to step up.
Now I'm going to ask Vice President Harris to say a few words, and then we'll move on. Madam Vice President, the floor is yours.
Vice President Kamala D. Harris. Thank you, Mr. President. First, I just want to thank the President for prioritizing this for his administration.
[At this point, the Vice President continued her remarks, concluding as follows.]
And the bottom line is that: As the President has said, his bipartisan framework for infrastructure is going to address a lot of these challenges. But there is other work to be done, and so I look forward to staying in touch with all of you. And again, thank you for your leadership.
The President. Well, thank you.
Governor Brown, if you'd be willing, you could give us an overview of what you—the challenges are you western Governors are facing and what you think we should be doing and can do to help. I—the floor is yours.
Governor Kate Brown of Oregon. Thank you so much, Mr. President and Madam Vice President, for having us here for this incredibly important conversation.
[Gov. Brown continued her remarks, concluding as follows.]
And then, finally—and I just have to say, gratefully—our Good Neighbor Authority—we have partnered with the Federal Government over the years to reduce wildfire risk on Federal lands through collaborative processes, including prescribed burns, removing dead trees and underbrush. With the recent passage of our State legislation, we have an opportunity to fund even more of these Good Neighbor Authority projects together. It's a win, win, win. It creates jobs, creates healthy landscapes, and reduces wildfire risk. And we have the dollars to invest now.
So we look forward to partnering for you—with you, and we are incredibly grateful, Mr. President, for your leadership.
Back over to you.
The President. Well, Madam Governor, I'm not being solicitous when I say we're grateful for your leadership. I really mean it.
And one of the things that I'd like to ask before we move on is: What would you be looking for us to do at the Federal level to strengthen this agreement to build off the lessons that—you know, the Good Neighbor agreement? And is there anything in particular that is—you've learned from last season that would be—add to the needs of this season?
Gov. Brown. Well, you mentioned it in your remarks, Mr. President: Making sure we have resources to train our National Guards men and women prior to fire season has been extremely helpful the last two fire seasons. This should be universal practice nationwide. It's incredibly helpful. We have relied on our National Guard every step of the way throughout the pandemic, and we certainly rely on them in support activities and firefighting.
The other piece—and I see Chief Christiansen there—in terms of the Good Neighbor Authority, this has been extraordinary in our ability to put people back to work in our timber-dependent rural communities, in our ability to create healthy landscapes, in our ability to provide timber for the mills, and frankly, our ability to reduce wildfire risk.
And so more resources to collaborate and provide what you describe as ""comprehensive, collective efforts"" to reduce wildfire risk would be extremely helpful.
The President. Well, we ought to get—not in this moment—but we're ought to get, no pun intended, deeply in the weeds as to specifically what can be done.
And I'd ask my appropriate Cabinet members to be working with your people as to what we can do along those lines because it seems to be self-evident that that makes a lot of sense.
And—but we have a lot of other things to cover here, but I look to Dr. Sherwood: Are we moving to——
Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall. We're going to move shortly. If you want to ask any further questions of Governors, and we can move, with the press departing, and we'll continue our discussion.
The President. Let me ask the Vice President if she has any questions and/or any Cabinet member if they have any questions for the Governor.
Vice President Harris. What I'm interested—it's really a follow-up to what the President asked: What—with each consecutive wildfire season—and they are growing in terms of the enormity—what are we learning? And how can the Federal Government address the challenges and the gaps that you have seen with each fire season, in terms of the resources, but also the approach?
And—for example, including the public education piece; including the piece that is about encouraging the private sector, where appropriate, to be engaged around resilience and adaptation. On the issue of water policy, what kind of resources do you need that are also preventative as well as reactive to the wildfires themselves?
Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Adviser Sherwood-Randall. Governor Newsom, do you want to pick that one up?
Governor Gavin C. Newsom of California. Yes. Well, first, if I could just make a little indulgence—and thank you, Madam Governor and Madam Vice President—Mr. President, I've been waiting almost, well, 4½ years to hear a President say what you just said.
[Gov. Newsom continued his remarks, concluding as follows.]
And I just want to say we respect and appreciate your leadership, and we're just grateful and humbled that you took the time today to be with all of us.
The President. Well, look, Gov, this is a—I'm not doing anybody any favor. I just think if—if I were sitting in your seat or Governor Brown's seat, what I'd be—I mean, this is urgent.
And one of the things that I have found since becoming President is how often I'm required to call in the National Guard.
Vice President Harris. Yes.
The President. The National Guard. I spent yesterday—well, that's not true—2 days ago—meeting with our military. What they've done is just astounding. I just met with the general who had coordinated probably the largest effort to—the largest logistical effort in American history getting all these COVID vaccines out.
I mean, think about what—how we're relying on the military in ways we never, ever, ever anticipated. And now I got my briefing at NOAA on what was going on in hurricane season. And it's, you know—and we're looking for the National Guard there too.
And so we just have to think differently, like you all have been talking about. And I promise you, when we get down to the nitty gritty—and a lot of this we're already getting down there—you got to tell us what you need. And we can debate it. We can discuss it.
And I think this is a—you know, that old overused expression—a ""wake-up call"" to the rest of the public, who all of a sudden is saying—I've had people say to me, when I've been on the road the last month—less than that; probably the last 3 weeks—""Oh, my God. I didn't think things were really changing that much. I saw those—those photographs of the reservoirs in California, and—oh, my God—they're really—there's no water?"" Or people saying, ""A hundred and seventeen degrees and—you know, in Portland?""
So I think this is both—you know, the old expression—we've got to make lemonade out of lemons here. We have a chance to do something that not only deals with the problem today, but allows us to be in a position to move forward to make and create real good jobs, by the way, generate economic growth in all the process.
So thank you.

Remarks on Jobs and Infrastructure Legislation in La Crosse, Wisconsin
","
Good afternoon. Thank you, Laurie. Please, please, please sit down. I once said that to a big crowd; it was in the evening. I said, ""Please, sit down."" And there were no seats. They were out in a football field. [Laughter] And the press pointed out, ""Biden is losing it."" [Laughter] But I can see you all have seats. [Laughter]
Laurie, thank you very much. I told Laurie, when she was showing me the bus she's driving now: Back when I was in law school, I drove a school bus during the summers to pick up spending money. And from one bus driver to another, Laurie—[laughter]—I want to thank you for all you do to make this city run, to help folks get where they need to go. And you do it in a way that sometimes is not always easy.
I'm glad to be here with great Wisconsin leaders. Gov, I guess I landed at the airport just a few minutes before you did. Thank you for making the effort to be here. And my good friend, Tammy Baldwin—Senator Baldwin is here. And Congressman Ron Kind is—and, Mom, thank you for raising a good kid.
And Mayor Reynolds. I was telling the mayor—he just won reelection—he won election. And I said, ""You know, I always wonder why everybody runs for mayor,"" because they—it's the hardest job in American politics. They know where you live. [Laughter] You can't go to the grocery store. ""Why is that pothole still there?"" I get it. You don't even control that. But anyway, Mr. Mayor, thank you for your service. Thank you for willing to serve.
I'm here in Wisconsin to celebrate a step forward for my country—our country—to talk a little bit about what it's going to mean for working families here in Wisconsin and across the Nation. When I was sworn in 5 months ago, I pledged to put my whole soul into bringing America together. I said I was running for three reasons, the last one of which I said is to unite America.
I admit it's difficult, and I think some of my friends in the press thought it was impossible. I still don't think it is, but—because I believe that there's nothing we cannot do if we bring—come together as a nation, Democrats and Republicans. And we're really divided on a whole range of things.
But if you look back across our history, from the transcontinental railroad to the creation of the internet, you can see the truth in that idea, about coming together. Because America—America—has always been propelled into the future by landmark national investments—investments that only the Government has the capacity to make; only the Government, working together, could make.
Today happens to mark—coincidental—but today is the 60th [65th]* anniversary of one of those significant investments to change the Nation. Sixty-five years ago today, President Dwight Eisenhower signed the bill that created the Interstate Highway System. Sixty-five years ago today. That was the last infrastructure investment of the size and scope of what—the agreement I'm about to talk about today.
It's time for us to write a new chapter in that story. After months of careful negotiation, of listening, of compromising together in a good faith, moving together, with ups and downs and some blips, a bipartisan group of Senators got together and they forged an agreement to move forward on the key priorities of my American Jobs Plan, and one of them is sitting in front of me.
As a result, this is a generational investment—a generational investment—to modernize our infrastructure, creating millions of good-paying jobs—and that's not coming from me, that's coming from Wall Street—millions of good-paying jobs that position America to compete with the rest of the world in the 21st century, because China is way out-working us, in terms of infrastructure.
And it's going to make the world of difference for families here in Wisconsin. Here's what it's going to do: This deal will put American workers to work in good-paying jobs, not minimum wage jobs, not 15-dollar-an-hour jobs. Prevailing wage jobs, good-paying jobs, repairing our roads and our bridges.
You all know why that matters. One in 5 miles of highway and roads in America are in poor condition—1 in 5 miles. Some States it's worse where the weather is tougher. Five percent—50 years—50 [40]* percent of our bridges are over 50 years old. More than 1,000 bridges here in Wisconsin are rated as structurally deficient by engineers—1,000 just in Wisconsin.
And I'm not—that doesn't make Wisconsin better or worse; it's—all across the Nation, it's this way. The bridges—the 10 most traveled bridges in America need repair, and some need to be completely rebuilt. More than 600—more than 600 here in the State of Wisconsin—bridges have weight limits to prevent trucks from crossing. That means long detours for farmers heading to market.
It's more than just an inconvenience; it's about safety as well. In November 2019, a school bus in Arcadia, Wisconsin, tipped over going around a curve and went into a ditch with 20 students on board. It wasn't because of snow or ice; it was just an old country road. It was rough conditions. Thank God nobody was seriously injured at the time.
But this is a drain on our economy as well. Typical American—typical American—and it varies slightly from State to State—but the typical American pays a hidden tax of more than $1,000 a year in wasted time—wasted time—and fuel due to traffic congestion. Now, in the more the rural the areas, the less the congestion. But that creates other difficulties. You all know that feeling: losing time, sitting in traffic, or being rerouted because the bridge isn't wide enough or the road is poorly maintained.
This deal is going to put Americans back to fixing all of that and good-paying jobs. This deal will also put Americans to work replacing 100 percent of our Nation's lead water pipes. You know, there's 400,000—well, I won't get into the numbers; I get a little carried away—but it's really dangerous. Every single American child, at home or in school, will soon be able to turn on that faucet, and their moms and dads know that the water they're drinking is clean and safe.
I'll give you an example of why that matters. Just look at the city of Milwaukee. Milwaukee has more than 160,000 water service lines. More than 70,000 of them, nearly half, have lead service lines. And by the way, I'm not—it's not picking on Wisconsin, Gov. Every State is like this. But just to know what you're going to be doing for the State of Wisconsin here.
You know, we know that exposure to lead in drinking water can trigger a number of serious problems. Even low levels of lead can cause behavioral and learning problems in children, impairing their growth. There are up to 10 million homes with lead pipe service lines and pipes. Children in up to 400,000 schools—400,000 schools—and childcare facilities are at risk of exposure to lead. This deal contains the largest investment in clean drinking water and waste water infrastructure in American history.
This deal also provides something you're very familiar with in the Island. It provides funding to get dangerous chemicals out of our water systems, known as PFAs, or ""forever chemicals."" This is a problem all across the country, and I know that you're feeling it right here—right here.
Here in La Crosse County, just this spring, the State had to provide free bottled water to thousands of people on French Island because they were worried about those chemicals in the groundwater, which were linked to cancer and other illnesses. We'll pay for that. We'll get that done. We're also going to surge Federal resources to help address the forever chemicals not just here, but all across America. Unfortunately, Wisconsin is not unique in this problem.
This deal will also put Americans to work building transmission lines, the largest investment in clean energy transmission in American history. Power outages cost the U.S. economy up to—now, this is—now, we know this, but until you add it up, it doesn't seem to be that big a deal. It costs the economy, Congressman, $70 billion annually. You hear me? Nationally, $70 billion annually.
And as climate change induces extreme weather events more and more frequently, we need to make investments to build a more resilient grid to carry this electricity.
The majority of the Nation's grid is aging. Some components are over a century old. And 70 percent of transmission and distribution lines are well into the second half of their lifespans. You saw what happened in Texas this winter: The entire system in the State collapsed. The entire system.
That's why we have to act. This deal will modernize the power grid to be more energy efficient and resilient to—and resistant to extreme weather; resilient against bad actors who try to hack and attack the grid. Because I just spent a lot of time in Europe trying to work on that.
And it's going to strengthen and revitalize our natural infrastructure, like our coastlines and levees, while preparing our physical infrastructure for wildfires, floods, and other extreme weather.
Anybody ever believe you'd—you hear—turn on the news, and it will say it was 116 degrees in Portland, Oregon. A hundred and sixteen degrees. ""But don't worry, there is no global warming. It doesn't exist. It's a figment of our imagination."" Seriously.
When a severe storm rolls in, like you had in some parts of the State just recently, the power is going to be less likely to go out, the town water systems will be able to withstand what happens if we—once we make these investments.
And all—as all of you know, America has one of the highest road fatality rates of anywhere in the industrial world. Let me say that again: the highest road fatality rates of any industrial nation in the world. I lost a wife and daughter and almost lost two sons.
Look, our fatality rate is double the rate in Canada on a per capita basis. I bet every one of you here can tell me what the most dangerous intersections in your town are. I'll lay eight to five, no matter what the town is. Maybe you don't have many, but everybody knows what intersections are the most dangerous.
When you're teaching your kid to drive, what do you do? You tell them, ""No, don't go down that road when you come home."" I'm being deadly earnest. ""When you come home, come home the other way."" Well, guess what? We've got an agreement to invest $11 billion to help cities and localities reduce crashes and fatalities in the community, especially for cyclists and pedestrians, which are increasing significantly.
This deal is going to more than double the funding directed to State and local programs that improve the safety of people in vehicles, including highway safety, truck safety, pipeline and hazardous materials safety.
I won't even get into this now, but you know, we have thousands of miles of pipeline. The vast majority of those pipes are 60 years or older, some of them more than 80 years old. A lot of them are leaking.
This is the United States of America, for God's sake. What are we not doing?
This deal will also help high-speed internet and make sure it's available to every American home, including 35 percent of rural families who currently go without it.
As of last spring, more than 82,000 children here in Wisconsin, which prides itself on its education, didn't have reliable internet access at home. Think about that year—in a year of remote schooling. When so many of our needs and our connections were forced to move online, tens of thousands of Wisconsin kids got left behind.
Did you ever think, here in America, that kids would have to sit in a fast-food parking lot just to do their schoolwork and homework because they could connect online? Not a joke. Ask any mom who has kids in school or a dad who is taking care of them. No child should have to do that. And no farmer here in Wisconsin should lose business because they don't have a reliable connection to the internet: know when to buy, know when to sell, and know what's going on.
You know, back in 1936, the Federal Government brought electricity to nearly every home and farm in America, and it spread the opportunity out for cities in every part of the country. It changed the lives and fortunes of thousands and thousands of homeowners, thousands of hometowns, and millions of American families. And it set the stage for a massive, sustained economic boom that would follow World War II.
High-speed internet is the equivalent of that today. It's a similar—it's an equivalent of that. It isn't a luxury; it's now a necessity, like water and electricity. And this deal would provide for it for everyone, while bringing down the cost of internet service across the board.
This deal has also put Americans to work through a first-ever national effort to install electric vehicle charging stations, 500,000 charging stations nationwide along our highways and in rural and disadvantaged communities as well.
Think about what that can mean to the American autoworker and the future of electric vehicles. China is going full bore. They're providing more electric vehicles than any nation in the world. You know, it used to be, when I first got to the United States Senate, actually a couple of—actually, in the sixties, when I was getting out—the late sixties, when I was getting out of law school, what happened? We invested more in R&D and investment and manufacturing than any nation in the world. Now we're number eight in the world. China used to be number nine; now they're number two in the world.
And when you build a charging station, it spurs even more investment and more infrastructure around it: the local convenience store, the local hamburgers place. You know, think about—nobody is old enough, but my dad used to tell me—because he worked, back in the days, for the American Oil Company—they came along with automobile—the combustion engine. You needed to be able to put gas in the engine, I mean, in the car, the tank. Well, guess what? You had to build gas stations.
One of my dad's jobs and my Grandpop Biden's jobs was to go from city to city convincing them it was okay to bury these great big tanks with gasoline in them. And entire communities grew up around it.
Well, this is exactly what we have to do with regard to electric vehicles. This deal is also going to help our cities, our towns, our school districts deploy electric buses. Thirty-five thousand electric school buses that are accounted for. And there are about 475,000 school buses in this country, 95 percent of them like the ones you had here——
[At this point, a child fell off a chair.]
——is he okay, honey? You sure? He took a little bit of a tumble.
Ninety-five percent of them run on diesel. So, every day, more than 25 million kids and thousands of bus drivers breathe polluted air on the way to and from school. Diesel air pollution is linked to asthma and other health problems. It hurts communities. It causes students to get sick and miss time in school. We owe it to our kids to clean up the school buses, and this deal will help do just that.
I know that the city of La Crosse is getting two electric transit buses this fall; I think I saw them both. I was down in the Carolinas, looking at the bus company where you're going to buy them—charging stations to power them.
This bipartisan deal—by the way, you had half Republicans and half Democrats come along and present this deal and negotiate this deal. It's going to help advance that effort.
This deal also modernizes our outdated airports, ports, and waterways. That means fewer delays that drain away so much money from families and from businesses. There's no good reason why that zero—zero—of the top 25 airports in the world are in American. Zero. Not one in the United States of America.
This deal will put Americans to work through long-overdue national environmental cleanups. That means good-paying jobs, capping hundreds of thousands of abandoned oil and gas wells that need to be cleaned up and capped—methane leaks—protecting the health of our communities. Making the same money it took to dig that well. And there's thousands of them.
Not to mention, this deal represents the largest investment in American passenger rail and in freight rail since the creation of Amtrak.
Now, I know I'm ""Mr. Amtrak."" I've traveled over 2 million miles on Amtrak. I commuted every day. I get it. I know you think I'm nuts. But, after my wife and daughter were killed, I decided to commute back and forth to Delaware. It was a 257-mile roundtrip.
I'll tell you a real quick story. I shouldn't bore you with it. But you know, the Secret Service—they're the best in the world—doesn't like you taking Amtrak because it stops too many times—the train. They want me flying home in the small jets that were available as Vice President. And—but that cost a lot of money, so I would go home on Fridays, you know, because my mom was passing away. I'd go home on Amtrak. And they published—they keep fastidious record of the miles you travel in an Air Force aircraft as President and Vice President.
And toward the end of my term, a headline came out in all of the papers: ""Biden travels""—I think it was 1.3 or 1.7 million miles on Air Force planes. And so I'm getting on the train on that Friday, and these guys who all became my family—all—the conductors. And a guy named Angelo Negri came up, and he goes, ""Joey, baby!"" Grabs my cheek like that. [Laughter] And I thought they were going to shoot him. I really did. [Laughter]
I said, ""No, no, no, no, no, no, no. He's a friend."" He was like, ""What the hell."" And he said, ""Big deal, Joey. A million""—whatever it was—""three-hundred thousand miles. You know how many miles you've traveled on Amtrak, Joey?"" And I said, ""No, Ange. I don't."" And he said: ""At that retirement dinner, we calculated it. We estimated 127 days a year, 250 miles back and forth, three—36 years, then as Vice President. Joey, you traveled more on Amtrak."" [Laughter]
Well, I—and when they named a station after me in my city, someone complained that Biden is using his influence. I said, ""Hell, they should name the whole Northeast Corridor after me."" I've—[laughter]—more than anybody else.
But all kidding aside, studies show that if you can get to your destination in the same amount of time or less on rail than you can by car, people will take rail. And, Gov, you know this better than anybody. Imagine if you could get from Chicago—from La Crosse to Chicago in 2 hours, instead of 4½. That's what this will allow us to build the capacity to do.
And besides, it will not only make your travel easier, not—I don't know why you'd go to Chicago, but—you know, all kidding aside—it would reduce the largest source of pollution in America: vehicle travel.
We're not just tinkering around the edges here. We're going to invest $66 billion in rail to eliminate backlogs, bring world-class rail service to areas outside the Northeast. Here in Wisconsin, we'll add new stops in Green Bay, Madison, and Eau Claire.
This deal also makes the largest investment in public transit in American history. A whole lot of people here in Wisconsin depend on public transportations, like the bus system here in La Crosse, to get to work, to school, and get around. Because of this deal, it will be safer, quicker, cleaner, more frequent, and more available—more reliable. More transit options mean more people can access good jobs as well. One study found that it leads to higher wages for workers because businesses can attract more customers with the rail.
This bipartisan breakthrough is a great deal for the American people—not just for folks in the cities, not just for red States or blue States, but for everybody. And this job—this jobs—the jobs that are going to be created here, largely, it's going to be those for blue-collar workers, the majority of whom will not have to have a college degree to have those jobs.
A lot of those folks are being left behind now. The guys I grew up with in Scranton and Claymont are being left behind. This is the answer for good-paying jobs. Jobs is—jobs not just in our biggest cities, along our coasts, but in small towns across the country so families can build wealth and opportunity in rural hometowns and don't have to leave when they're grown up.
I've said it all along: This is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America, and long before, families in Wisconsin are going to see the benefits firsthand. Look, I'm always quoting my dad because he was smart and I loved him. My dad used to say: ""Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about your place in the community."" I mean he really would say this. When he lost everything in Scranton and we had to move down to Claymont, Delaware, a little steel town.
And he said—and the deal is going to deliver breathing room. All he said was, ""All you want, as a middle-class person, is just to have a little bit of breathing room. Not—just a little bit of breathing room."" That's why we've got to build this economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not trickle down, creating good-paying jobs with dignity and jobs that cannot be outsourced.
And critically, we're going to get it all done without raising taxes on a single American earning less than $400,000. Now, all of you making over $400,000, I love you, but I don't mind a little bit if your taxes go up a little bit.
But all kidding aside, I made a commitment: Nobody—I would not support anything that raised a penny in tax on someone making under 400 grand. And that means, in this bill, there is no gas tax. Working families have already paid enough.
Instead, we're going to pay for these investments, in part, by giving the Internal Revenue Service the resources it needs to collect taxes on the wealthiest Americans who owe, but are currently not paying under the existing tax rules. And by the way, it's not done by this—it will be done by conservative economists and liberal economists. It cracks down on tax cheats, not just hard-working, middle class Americans.
And there's a lot of important investments in this deal that are long overdue. Economists of all stripes agree that it's going to create good jobs and dramatically strengthen our economy in the long run. It makes it easier for businesses to seamlessly transport their goods, makes it easier for workers to more easily access job opportunities.
But the reason this agreement matters so much: It's about what it represents. This deal isn't just the sum of its parts; it's a signal to ourselves and to the world that American democracy can come through and deliver for all our people. We can be united.
I just met with the G-7. I just met with all of NATO. And I just met with Putin. The autocrats think that democracy can't keep up with autocrats. Not a joke. But it's living proof that we can still come together in this country and accomplish something big and transformational.
I know that neither Democrats nor Republicans get everything they want in this agreement. It's not all that I proposed. But that's what our economy is all about. That's what it means to compromise and reach consensus. And that's what every—in the heart of every democracy.
And we can't give up on what we—keep finding ways to come together. Because every time we negotiate in good faith and come together to get something big done, we break a little more of the ice that too often keeps us frozen in place and prevents us from solving the real problems people are facing.
Let me be clear: There's much more to do. And I'm going to continue to fight for more. I'm going to keep working with Congress to pass even more of my economic agenda so we can keep building an economy from the bottom up and the middle out.
As we bring home key parts of my American Jobs Plan, I'm going to make the case—and I've told this to the negotiators—I'm going to continue to make the case there are critical investments are still needed, including those in my Family Plan—American Family Plan.
Maybe the most important among them is extending the child tax credit, which will significantly benefit middle class and working folks. Let me explain what that is. Pretty soon, taxpayers in America are going to get a significant check back from the IRS. For example, if you are—if you have to pay taxes and you have a good income, you get to deduct $2,000 per dependent—per child. And that comes off the bottom line of your taxes, and you probably still owe more after that's cut off.
But for families who, in fact, don't have that big a tax bill, they don't get anything from this. So we changed the law this year, and it's cutting child poverty by 40 percent. And here in Wisconsin, by July 15, we're going to start—they're going to be picking up the phone and calling you to say, ""Thanks, Gov."" And they're going to get checks from the IRS.
Here's what they did: For every child you have under the age of 6, you're going to get $3,600. And for every child under the age of—between—over the age of 12, you're going to get $3,000. So you'll actually get a cash payment instead of just a credit against your taxes, because you don't pay that many taxes if you're—if you're making—if you're making the minimum wage or you're making $20-, $30-, $40,000 a year. And people say, ""Well, that's a giveaway."" Hey, guys, I think it's time to give ordinary people a tax break. [Laughter] The wealthy are doing fine. No, I mean it. I mean it.
Why is this not a tax break for working folks, when the stuff we give to the superwealthy are called ""tax breaks""? Look, major action on clean energy, housing, caregiving, on child and paid leave, universal pre-K, free community college. The human infrastructure is intertwined with our physical infrastructure. It's going to help us create more good jobs, ease the burden on working families, and strengthen our economy in the long run.
And I'm going out—I'm going to be out there making the case for the American people until this job is done; until we bring this bipartisan deal home; until our human infrastructure, also, needs are met; until we have a fair tax system to pay for all of this.
And by the way, what I'm talking about in the Family Plan, let me tell you how I'm going to pay for it. And the American people, in the polling data, overwhelmingly support it. If we just raise the corporate tax to 28 percent—it used to be 35 percent. It was supposed to come down to 28; it's now 21. If you raise it to 28 percent, you know how much money that raises? One-point-four trillion dollars. If you have a minimum global tax, which we agreed to in Europe—that means so corporations can't avoid paying the taxes at home—that would generate, in America, $385 billion. If you end deductions for foreign corporations who ship their profits out of the United States, that raises $260 billion in these tax havens.
You know, there are 30 corporations in America of Fortune 500 making billion—I'm—I come from the corporate capital of the world, Delaware. Not a joke. More corporations are incorporated in Delaware than all the rest in America combined. Okay? Well, guess what? Fifteen of the Fortune 500 companies last year paid—I mean, 30—excuse me—paid zero taxes, and they made billions of dollars. Paid not a penny in tax, not a single cent.
I'm not trying to punish anybody. I'm just saying, ""Let's be fair."" If you just set up a minimum tax—you had to pay at least 15 percent of your earnings as a corporation—that alone would raise $230 billion.
The point is, I have never had a reputation of being someone who's out there trying to just out-tax people. But here's the deal, folks: I think it's about time there be fairness in the tax code. I don't want you paying more than your share.
But the tax cut that was passed under Trump—the $2 trillion, not a penny of which was paid for—where did it go? Over 80 percent of it went to the top one-quarter of 1 percent. I think you should be able to be a billionaire. I think you should be able to be a millionaire. But, for God's sake, at least pay. Pay your fair share. Pay your fair share.
Folks, there's a lot of work ahead to finish the job I've just outlined. There'll be more disagreements to resolve, more compromises to forge along the way.
But today, the American people can be proud of Democrats and Republicans; families here in Wisconsin can be proud; Congress can be proud, because this country came together, forged a bipartisan deal—which a lot of has to do with your State—your Senator—that delivers for everybody. We've shown the world, and just as importantly, we've shown ourselves that American democracy can come through. There's nothing—nothing, nothing—beyond our capacity when we come together as one Nation.
So thank you, Wisconsin. Thank you all for who you are and what you do. May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, Wisconsin.

Remarks at a Democratic National Committee Virtual Fundraiser
","
Reed, thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you for hosting this event and for your generous support. I might note that—I was saying to you when I got to speak to you a few minutes earlier that, you know, you haven't even—we haven't even sat down with each other. You know, anybody who contributed and raised as much funds as you did, everybody expects to be knocking on my door for—you never asked me for a single thing. You've raised an enormous amount of money, and you said: ""The reason why we haven't gotten together, Mr. President, is because we didn't want to distract you. We want you to keep going."" And I'm like—I really mean it. I hope everybody understands that about almost all of you on this call. And I want to thank you for your incredible support.
And, Jaime, I think that Leader Clyburn was correct: You're the right choice for this job. You've been doing outstanding leadership. And let me just say that you're part of something special. We're bound together in one of the most consequential campaigns in the history of this country. It really was a battle for the soul of America.
And I just got back, by the way, from Europe after being there for, I guess, 13 days. I don't—I forget how many days. And I met for 5 days with the G-7 nations. I also—and then there were four others that were there—India, Australia. And I won't go through all the detail; it'd be too boring for you. And then, I went to a NATO meeting with all the NATO representatives there and the heads of state. And then, I went to meet with Putin. Actually, in between, I did the EU.
And here's the bottom line: I think—I know you all understood it: the incredible damage done to us, internationally, by the last outfit that sat in this seat. And I have to say, sitting here tonight, I've lived through what we've lived through. We know just how important it was. It turns out it was even more important than I thought it was.
Think about the last 150 days: The American Rescue Plan delivered shots in the arms. And by the way, we are in a position where we're getting close to making sure that 70 percent of all the people in America will have been fully vaccinated or at least get one shot by the—by Independence Day. We're way ahead. No one thought we could ever do that.
And I'm in the process of being able to announce very shortly that we're going to generate—half a billion doses we're going to give away between—after taking care of every single American. Half a billion doses give away to the poorest countries in the world. And that's what you do when you want to really help and influence people around the world.
And we put—and—but beyond that, they—you know, the act put shots in arms and checks in pockets for hundreds of millions of Americans who are on the edge. It's keeping food on the table, a roof over their heads. And maybe the thing I'm proudest of is, it's putting us back on track to cut child poverty in half.
A hundred and fifty million Americans are fully vaccinated now. The fastest job growth in the first 4 months, I'm told—not because of me, but because of all of you—of any previous Presidency. Projected economic growth at nearly 7 percent, the highest in four decades.
And just last week, I announced a bipartisan agreement in the Senate asking to make one of the biggest investments ever in infrastructure—ever—rebuilding our roads and bridges; delivering high-speed internet to every American family, rural and as well as in urban areas; delivering every clean water, getting rid of those lead pipes to every American; building a more resilient power grid; installing electric vehicle charging stations, over half a million of them. This is the largest investment in public transit ever and the largest investment in rail since the creation of Amtrak 50 years ago. It's about creating millions of good-paying jobs, and it's about our economic competitiveness.
You all know better than I, because you're all successful people, that we're in a race in the 21st century to—who's going to have a strongest economy in the 21st century. And the rest of the world is not waiting around. We have more to do, and we have to move fast and move quickly.
This is a—and this agreement, this infrastructure bill that—you know, it signals in the world that we can function, we can deliver. We can do significant things and show that America is back. That's the message I delivered and received during the trip in Europe. I announced that America is going to help vaccinate the world, because that's who we are. That's what we can do.
I also rallied our European allies to holding China to the same rules of the road in a global economy in the 21st century.
I made clear to President Putin and Russia that the relationship between America and Russia should be stable and predictable. We should be able to cooperate where we have our interests, on nuclear nonproliferation and climate change. And where we have differences, I made it clear to President Putin that I understand why—we have to understand what exists, and whether it's on cyber attacks or interference in our economy, I will respond. I will respond. And I know we'll respond to specific kinds of actions that harm U.S. interests.
The bottom line of all this at home and abroad: We're proving that our democracy can deliver for the people when autocrats are betting we can't.
But we've got a lot more to do. As we invest in our physical infrastructure, we also have to invest in our human infrastructure, the so-called Biden Family Plan bill. We're going to move on the American Family Plan that will deliver childcare, paid leave, universal pre-K, 2 years of community college, and so much more.
And I will take the case to the American people on the need to protect the sacred right to vote. It's under assault in ways that I haven't seen in my entire career, and that's what got me involved in the first place. It's about who gets to vote and whether the vote counts. And we have a system that does both with integrity and independence. But the Republicans want to do what no political party has ever tried to do: get to decide if your vote counts. It's outrageous. We're going to fight like hell to make sure that doesn't happen.
There's so much to say on all of these subjects. I'm sorry—[inaudible]—such shorthand.
But to work—the work has not been easy, and I'm going to need all of you to help do that work. The DNC is going to need you, because here's the deal: We won in 2020 as a unified party, and we need to stay unified and keep doing the big consequential things.
If we make the right decisions in the next 4—[inaudible]—years, in 50 years, people will look back and say this was the moment that America won the future. But we can't do it without you. And it's not hyperbole to suggest what I said—that America won the future.
So look, there's so much more to say, but the bottom line is that there's so much at stake. But I promise you—I promise you—I've heard from almost every major world leader—I've heard from every major world leader: We can do this. So we can, in the process, be helping the rest of the world by doing well for ourselves.
May God bless America, and may God protect our troops. And I look forward to meeting you all in a virtual photo line, which I guess is going to begin very shortly.

Remarks Prior to a Meeting With President Reuven Rivlin of Israel and an Exchange With Reporters

President Biden. Well, I'm really happy to have President Rivlin here. And I don't want to—it's not technically appropriate, but I'm so delighted his daughter is here. She's in the back right there. And I got to meet her and talk about our kids and grandkids and all the like.
At any rate, I just want to thank the President for being here and for your dedication to strengthening the relationship between the United States and Israel.
President Rivlin. Thank you.
President Biden. And as the American press here can tell you, my commitment to Israel is—well, they can't tell you anything actually; they're not supposed to—but it's ironclad. It's real. It's something that—I often say, if there weren't an Israel, we'd have to invent one.
And so this includes, we're—you know, we're committed to—unwavering commitment to your self-defense. And today we're going to be discussing a broad range of challenges, including Iran. What I can say to you: Iran will never get a nuclear weapon on my watch, as they say.
President Rivlin. God bless you.
President Biden. And you know, the—I directed last night's airstrikes targeting sites used by the Iranian-backed militia groups responsible for recent attacks on the U.S. personnel in Iraq. And I have that authority under Article II. And even those up in the Hill who are reluctant to acknowledge that have acknowledged that's the case.
I also want to be clear that, as I said, my team and I are already working closely with the Israeli Government to—that took office earlier this month. I'm looking forward to hosting Prime Minister Bennett at the White House very soon. And the U.S. fully supports normalization of the relationship between Israel and Middle Eastern countries—that you're making some headway on—and Africa as well.
And beyond, the important progress we are really looking forward to building back a wider block of peace and stability. And, going forward, Mr. President, the United States and Israel are going to continue to work together to advance peace in the region and stability.
And I've only one regret: You're leaving as President. But not immediately, and not soon.
President Rivlin. Seven years, for Israel, is enough. For the Americans, 8 years could be——
President Biden. Eh—[laughter].
President Rivlin. ——a little bit longer. But for the Israelis, 7 years, it's enough.
President Biden. Well, welcome.
President Rivlin. It's good to be President, I must say to you. Yes.
President Biden. [Laughter] Well, you've done incredibly well. You've been a great friend.
President Rivlin. I did. Absolutely.
President Biden. You've been a great friend.
President Rivlin. I did my best, of course.
President Biden. Well, you did your best, and it was as good as it could be.
President Rivlin. Thank you. There was——
President Biden. All right, everybody. You have anything else you'd like to say?
President Rivlin. Of course, I would like to say and to mention that I'm delighted—really delighted—to be here once again in the White House meeting you, the President of the United States.
Of course, I have to repeat what we know very well: Israel have no greater friend, ally than the United States of America. You are our best friends, and we are sharing—we are best friends, and the bonds between the people of Israel and the people of America is based on the understanding that we are sharing values: values of democracy and values of liberalism.
And because of that, of course, we, according to a real friendship, can from time to time discuss matters. And even the—agree not to agree about everything. But we count on you. And your, really, declaration just now really brought the Israelis to understand that we have a great friend at the White House.
President Biden. You do.
President Rivlin. Mr. President, God bless you, God bless the people of America, and God bless the relationship between our two nations and to our two states.
President Biden. Well, I agree with you. And I thank you very much for being here.
President Rivlin. Thank you.
President Biden. Thank you all very much.

Remarks Prior to a Meeting With President Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai and Chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation Abdullah Abdullah of Afghanistan and an Exchange With Reporters
","
President Biden. Well, it's good to see two old friends. We met many, many times in Afghanistan for long hours. And they're welcome here. They've had a chance to meet with the—all the major players of the administration—from the Secretary of Defense, to the CIA—across the board. And it's good to have them here in the White House.
The partnership between Afghanistan and the United States is not ending. It's going to be sustained. And you know, our troops may be leaving, but support for Afghanistan is not ending, in terms of support and maintenance of their—helping maintain their military, as well as economic and political support.
And they've both got very difficult jobs. Every time I think I've got a lot—tough job, I think, Mr. President——
President Ghani. [Laughter]
President Biden. ——but seriously, I—they're doing important work of trying to bring about unity among Afghan leaders up—across the board.
And they have to—Afghans are going to have to decide their future of what they want—what they want. But it won't be for lack of us being a help. There's going to be a—and the senseless violence that has to stop, but it's going to be very difficult.
But we're going to stick with you. And we're going to do our best to see to it you have the tools you need.
President Ghani. Well, thank you, Mr. President. First of all, let me pay tribute to the 2,448 Americans who paid the ultimate sacrifice, over a million American veterans who have served with honor and dignity for your security and our freedom.
The United States has not spared any effort in blood or treasure during these years. And as a grateful nation, I want to acknowledge that and ask you——
President Biden. Thank you.
President Ghani. ——to thank the Gold Star families.
Second, President Biden's decision has been historic. It has made everybody recalculate and reconsider. We are here to respect it and support it.
Third, we are entering into a new chapter of our relationship where the partnership with the United States would not be military, but comprehensive, regarding our mutual interest. And we're very encouraged and satisfied that this partnership is taking place. Thank you for ordering the priorities.
The Afghan nation is in an 1861 moment, like President Lincoln, rallying to the defense of the republic, determined that the republic is defended. It's a choice of values: the values of an exclusionary system or an inclusionary system. We're determined to have unity, coherence, national sense of sacrifice and will not spare anything.
Just for your information: Today, the Afghan Defense and Security Forces have retaken six districts, both in the south and the north. It's showing our determination. So I hope that nobody does the Bernard Shaw on us, exaggerating our death before something has happened.
Let us understand that in moments of great transition, things happen. But you will see that with determination, with unity, and with the partnership, we will overcome all odds. Thank you, Mr. President.
President Biden. Thank you. Thank you all. Appreciate it. Thank you.

Remarks at a LGBTQ+ Pride Month Reception

Well, my name is Joe Biden. I'm Jill Biden's husband. [Laughter]
Ashton, thank you. You seemed awfully comfortable up here. [Laughter] You were awfully comfortable up here. I don't know. I'm not sure I'll be around, but you know—[laughter]—if you're here, just don't pretend you don't know me. Okay? [Laughter]
Your story, your leadership, and your mom is an inspiration. Your mom. If my mother were here, she'd look at you and say, ""Honey, God love you, dear."" [Laughter] God love you—what you do, what you did, what you continue to do.
I want to thank Secretary—well, first of all, I want to say to Chasten: Belated happy birthday, Chasten. If you could hear us inside, we were singing happy birthday to him. We got a bunch of cupcakes, but not enough for everybody. [Laughter] But—and, Mr. Secretary, thank you. You are—you're the best, man.
Look, our presence here this afternoon makes a simple, strong statement: Pride is back at the White House. [Applause] Pride is back at the White House. For this community and for our Nation and for the world, Pride Month represents so much. It stands for courage: the courage of all those in previous generations and today who proudly live their truth.
It stands for justice: both the steps we've taken and the steps we need to take. And above all, Pride Month stands for love—you know, being able to love yourself, love whomever you love, and love this country enough to make it more fair and more free and more just.
You know, during the campaign, Tim Gill and Scott Miller—and Tim—one of them is here today, I don't want to embarrass him; he always gets mad when I do that—[laughter]—brought me and Jill to visit the Stonewall Inn. I wanted to go, and they wanted—they offered to take me. We wanted to pay tribute to that hallowed ground that represents the fight to ensure that all people are treated with dignity and respect.
Just a few minutes ago, surrounded by the survivors of family members who were—we've lost, I signed a bill consecrating another piece of hallowed ground: the Pulse nightclub. And I want to thank all of the Members of the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate for standing up and making sure that will never be forgotten. Never be forgotten. The site of the deadliest attack affecting the LBT—LGBTQ+ community in American history. It's now a national memorial.
This month, on the way to the office, I walk through—from my—from the Residence to the Oval Office every morning—I walk through a hallway lit with rainbow colors of Pride, which you'll have a chance to see in just a few minutes. You'll see a candle carried during the AIDS vigil in the early nineties by a pair—and a pair of sandals belonging to Matthew Shepard.
They're reminders of how much this community has suffered and lost. But they're also reminders of this community's incredible resiliency, the incredible contributions, the incredible—including, we just saw, the National Football League and the National Women's Soccer League.
All of you here—Henry Muñoz and Kyle—good to see you, man—[laughter]. I had the—I had the opportunity to officiate at their wedding. [Laughter] And Representative Malcolm Kenyatta—where are you, Malcolm? You're around here some—good to see you, man. And Dr. Matt Miller—they stole the show at the Democratic Convention. [Laughter]
And my friend, Sarah McBride—where is Sarah? Sarah? Sarah worked closely with my son Beau when he was attorney general of the State of Delaware and is now serving Delaware, as well, as one of the first openly transgender State legislators in history. Senator. You just heard from our history-making Secretary of Transportation. And we have today the first openly transgender person ever confirmed to the U.S. Senate—you just met her—Dr. Levine.
Representation matters. Recognition matters. But there's something else that matters: Results. Results. I am proud to lead the most pro-LGBTQ equality administration in U.S. history. And even on the very—my very first day in office, the first Executive order I signed was to change the whole of the Federal Government to commit to work aggressively to root out discrimination against LBT—LGBTQ+ people and their families. That was the first Executive order.
I ordered our agencies—every agency—to rapidly implement the Supreme Court's ruling in Bostock, which affirmed that civil rights protections on the basis of sex apply to sexual orientation and gender identity.
And as a result of that Executive order, the Department of Housing and Urban Affairs [Development]* announced that it would be—take steps to protect LGBTQ+ people from discrimination in housing and ensured critical protections for transgender Americans experiencing homelessness.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced it would work to combat discrimination against LGBTQ+ people in credit and lending. The Department of Health and Human Services announced it would protect against discrimination in health care services.
And just last week, the Department of Education made clear that title IX protections apply to sexual orientation and gender identity and prohibit discrimination against LGBTQ students in our Nation's schools.
And a moment ago, I signed an Executive order to advance diversity, equality, and inclusion, and accessibility across the entire Federal workforce. The order directs the entire Federal Government to eliminate barriers so people from every background and walk of life have an equal opportunity to serve our Nation, including LGBTQ+ folks and all employees in underserved communities.
Look, I also was proud to rescind the discriminatory and un-American ban on openly transgender servicemembers. Today we're joined by Lieutenant Colonel Bree Fram. Bree, Colonel—thank you. One of the highest ranking openly transgender servicemembers in the United States military. Lieutenant Colonel Fram, thank you for your service to our Nation. We owe you. Thank you.
And everyone who has served—everyone deserves the absolute high quality of health care. That's why I was so pleased that, last week, Secretary McDonough announced the Department of Veterans Affairs is beginning the process to provide more comprehensive gender-affirming care to our Nation's transgender—for our Nation's transgender veterans.
We're also making equality the centerpiece of our diplomacy around the world. We believe LGBTQ+ rights are human rights. In February, I signed a Presidential memorandum establishing that it's the policy of the United States to pursue an end to violence and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.
This month, Pride flags are flying—as some of my friends in our last—in the Obama-Biden administration who are openly gay—they are flying in more than over 130 U.S. Embassies around the world. A powerful—a powerful—symbol of our commitment to safety, dignity, and opportunity for all. And today I'm proud to announce that Jessica Stern, who many of you know, as an LGBT Special—Q+ Special Envoy at the State Department.
And yes, we're also making progress, but I know we still have a long way to go, a lot of work to do. But we must protect the gains we've made and fend off the cruel and unconscionable attacks we're seeing now to ensure that everyone enjoys the full promise of equality and dignity and protection.
When I was Vice President, I was proud—although, some—it won't surprise some people in the administration at the moment—[laughter]—and by the way, I did tell the President that I would not go out and proselytize, but if I was asked, I would not remain quiet. [Laughter] The President—I was proud to have called for marriage equality, along with Barack Obama, because, at the time, I said, ""Love is love, period.""
Six year ago, tomorrow, when the Supreme Court ruled in favor of marriage equality, we're all reminded of the White House lit up in rainbow colors. Shortly thereafter, I went to New York to celebrate with my friend Evan Wolfson and a team from—at Freedom To Marry. The joy was palpable.
But we knew then, as we know now, that our work is unfinished. When a same-sex couple can be married in the morning, but denied a lease in the afternoon for being gay, something is still wrong. Over half of our States—in over half of our States, LGBTQ+ Americans still lack explicit State-level civil rights protections to shield them from discrimination.
As I said as a Presidential candidate and in my first joint address to Congress, it's time for the United States Senate to pass the Equality Act and put the legislation on my desk. Put it on my desk. Harvey Milk was right when he said, quote, ""It takes no compromise to give people their rights."" It takes no compromise to give people their rights.
And by the way, this bill doesn't just protect LGBTQ+ people. It's also going to strengthen existing civil rights protections for people of faith, people of color, people with disabilities, women—in public accommodations, like doctors' offices, parks, and gyms. I want to thank the leaders of the Congressional Equity [Equality]* Caucus for their continued work to make it happen. The Equality Act will also help protect against the disturbing proliferation of anti-LGBTQ bills we're seeing in State legislatures.
So far this year, hundreds of anti-LGBTQ bills have been introduced in State legislatures. More than a dozen of them have already passed—more than a dozen of them. These are some of the ugliest, most un-American laws I've seen, and I've been here awhile. Many of them target transgender children, seeking to prevent them from receiving the appropriate medical care; for using the bathroom at high schools while they're—the one where they'll be most safe; even preventing them from joining sports teams with their classmates. Let's be clear: This is nothing more than bullying disguised as legislation.
As I've said before, many times, transgender kids are some of the bravest people in the world. I mean it sincerely. You just saw it with Ashton, and you'll see it with several other young people here. It takes courage to be true to your authentic self and to face—in the face of the—these kinds of discrimination you know exist. It takes a toll.
We know more than half of transgender youth seriously considered suicide just in the past year. These young people aren't hurting anyone, but these laws are hurting them. And they've got to stop.
Our deceased son Beau, when he was Delaware's attorney general, was one of the first AGs in the country to call for legislation to establish legal protections on the basis of gender identity to protect—to protect trans people—trans people. And now the Department of Justice has filed statements of interest in cases challenging two of these—those bills that got passed—explaining why they're so unconstitutional.
So we have to work. We have to work to do so much in these areas to support seniors, aging in isolation without support; to confront disproportionate levels of homelessness and poverty and unemployment in the LGBTQ community; to address the epidemic level of violence against transgender people, especially transgender women—as has been mentioned before, women of color—in the coming days, my administration is going to have more to say about that; and to finally eradicate the AIDS epidemic.
I'm not sure I'm allowed to talk about this—[laughter]—but our son Beau, who was a decorated war veteran and attorney general of the United—of the State of Delaware and should be standing here instead of me, came home from war after a year in Iraq and, before that, 6 months in Kosovo. And what he did—he decided he was going to set up a foundation for LGBTQ youth, but primarily focusing on transgender youth.
And he took all the money left from the campaign—he was going to run for Governor—and put it in and a lot more. Because in his working with everyone from YMCAs to all the areas where young people can find some solace—his buddy Chris Coons and my buddy Senator Coons knows what he's done.
The point is: A lot of transgender youth—those who commit suicide—based on the studies his foundation has done, do it because their mom doesn't understand, because mom or dad says, ""You can't be here anymore""—are rejected. So, folks, we've got a lot of work to do. A lot of it's basically public education.
Let me close with this: When you go downstairs, you'll see some of the Smithsonian exhibit. You get a sense of the long, long journey and how long it's been and how far we've come—have you come. But how much further we have to go.
So this afternoon we celebrate. But tomorrow we go back to work. Progress won't come easily; it never has. But we're going to stand strong, stand together. And I promise you, we will succeed. I promise you.
I said to folks earlier, you know things are—why—I always get asked by the press, ""Why are you so optimistic, Biden?"" Well, as my neurosurgeon once said, I'm probably a congenital optimist. But beyond that—[laughter]—it's a simple proposition.
Look at the young people: straight and gay, doesn't matter. They're the least prejudiced—this generation—the most open, the most giving, and the best educated generation in history. It's a fact. In all of history. And look where they are. Look how it's changing. It's changing in ways that—in my generation, 270 years ago—[laughter]—you'd get beat up for defending somebody.
But really and truly, there's a great reason for hope. And so much talent—so much talent can be unleashed by embracing the LGBT+ community—Q+ community.
So I want to thank you and say: Happy Pride. May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you.

Remarks on Signing Legislation To Designate the National Pulse Memorial
","
The President. I'm Joe Biden. I'm Jill's husband. [Laughter]
Collapse of the Champlain Towers South Condominium Building in Surfside, Florida 
Before I sign, let me start with a few words about what's going on now in Florida. And you know, the people who are here, who were part of what happened that night at the Pulse nightclub and the scores that I just spoke to a moment ago—they're online looking at this—they understand that—what it's like to have to wait and wonder what happened.
The families—I remember going down there to the Pulse nightclub afterwards—and wondering: ""Is it my son, my daughter, my husband, someone I love—is that who got lost?"" Because you didn't know for certain initially.
And as Congressman Cicilline knows, there's nothing worse than having to wait and wonder what happened. And I know, Val, when you were a police chief, you had to go through waiting a lot as well.
And so I just want to say, I've spoken to Governor DeSantis. And we've provided all the help that they have—they need. We sent the best people from FEMA down there. We're going to stay with them; with the disaster declaration we made, provide for everything from housing to, God forbid, whether there's a need for moratoria—if there are—to—for the bodies to be placed. Everything in between.
And—but I just want to say—and I'm sure I speak for all the Members of the Congress here today and all the survivors here that it's a tough, tough time. There's so many people waiting. ""Are they alive? Will they be—what will happen?"" And so our heart goes out to them.
And I—to the people of Florida, I want to—I've spoken to Debbie Wasserman Schultz. I've spoken to most of the folks down there and member—in authority. And I promise you, the administration, the Congress, we're doing everything possible to be of assistance now and after this occurs—after they decide exactly what the state of play is.
Legislation To Designate the National Pulse Memorial 
But I'm glad to welcome everyone here to the adjunct to the White House here, and in person and virtually: survivors and family members, victims, and the path-breaking leaders like Senator Baldwin.
Just over 5 years ago, the Pulse nightclub, a place of acceptance and joy, became a place of unspeakable pain and loss. And we'll never fully recovery, but we'll remember. And we have to—what we're going to do is what the Members of Congress here did and enshrine in law—as a consequence of that law, enshrine, in perpetuity, literally a monument to the loss that occurred there, and an absolute determination that we're going to deal with this every single, solitary day and make sure that we're not in a position to see this happen again.
Behind me, you see, on either board there, the 49 lives lost: family members, parents, friends, veterans, students, young, Black, Asian, Latino—all fellow Americans. And in their memory and for the countless others forever scarred is why I sign this today.
And let me say how much I appreciate it—and I mean this sincerely—the commitment of the Members of the House and Senate to make sure that we don't forget—that this isn't forgotten.
Now, there's a tradition when a bill is signed that the President gives a signing pen to each of the people who had something to do with the law or the decision being made in the first place.
I promise you, I have all the pens, but they're in the other room. I couldn't figure how to sign—[laughter]—sign them all. But don't leave without the pen. Okay? All right? All right.
Representative Mark A. Takano. Thank you, Mr. President.
Representative Darren M. Soto. Thank you, Mr. President.
[At this point, the President signed the bill.]
The President. May we never have to sign another—no President ever have to sign another monument like this. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
And one last thing, as I said to—to the survivors and their—those who lost folks, a little earlier, in private: You know, what the Congress has done means a great deal, and it's important. But it's really hard; it brings back everything as if it happened yesterday.
And every time there's a memorial service for our son Beau, you know, you're flattered. You feel good about it. You think it's wonderful—the recognition. But it's tough. It's as if it happened yesterday, it happened the day before, it happened the moment you're signing it.
So I want to thank the folks who are here and the folks who are survivors who are on Zoom with us. I want to thank them for their courage—I really mean it—for their courage.
But, I promise you, none of the Members of Congress that are here, nor I, nor Jill are going to let up until we deal with equity across the board.
Thank you so very much.
Equality Florida Action Inc. Central Florida Development Officer and Media Relations Manager Brandon Wolf. Thank you, Mr. President.
The President. And you've got to come back and get your pens. [Laughter]

Remarks on the COVID-19 Response and National Vaccination Efforts in Raleigh, North Carolina
","
The President. Hello, Raleigh. I'm going to——
Audience member. [Inaudible]—Joe!
Audience member. [Laughter] We love you!
The President. Love you back. Well, look, that old—I—you're—by the way, you're in the midst of the—you're in the presence of a—one hell of an individual I want you all to know about. Not me. [Laughter] He's always there when people need help, and he particularly focuses on people who are left behind: Reverend Barber. Thanks for all you do, Rev.
Ivy, I thank you for that introduction, you know, and for everything you're doing.
You know, I think—I thank you everyone here at the Green Road Community Center for hosting us. Governor Cooper, my good friend. A great Governor. But the most important thing: He's a man of enormous integrity, and—no, he really is. You're doing an incredible job; I'm lucky to have you as a partner, Gov, and as we move along here.
Look, you know, the main thing I want to do is start off with the way you should never start off. Are they—do you have chairs out there? [Laughter] Well, if you have a chair, sit. Don't stand for me. [Laughter] I was getting the—I was getting to feel really guilty, man. [Laughter]
I said that a while ago, as the press will tell you. About a year ago, I said, ""Why doesn't everybody sit down?"" And somebody in the front said: ""I don't have a damn seat. That's why."" [Laughter] I want to get in trouble. Thank you. I thought you didn't have any seats there. I was going to really feel guilty.
Folks, look, it's great to be with Mayor Baldwin of Raleigh and Mayor—Mayor Schewel of Durham. And joined by a proud native son of North Carolina: the Administrator of the EPA in Washington, DC, Michael Regan. Where are you, Michael? I'm always worried when I come back to North Carolina and Michael is with me that the Governor is going to take him back. [Laughter] But I need him.
Look, folks, he's doing one heck of a job at EPA. And if you want to talk about health, think about the environment. Think about what's happened—being done—what we're changing at EPA. And the—it makes a big deal.
It's also out there, across the State, encouraging people to get vaccinated as well. I wanted to come to Raleigh to thank everyone in this room for everything you're doing to get your community vaccinated. It matters. It matters. You're saving lives. That's not hyperbole.
Let me remind everybody: We lost 600,000 dead in America in about a year. That's more than every life lost in World War I, World War II, the Vietnam war, Iraq, Iran, across the board—Afghanistan. More lives lost in a year than every major war in the 20th century and the 21st century. And guess what, folks? There've been lives lost all around the world.
And, America, I might say—this is not—I didn't plan on saying this, but I'm going to anyway: We have an obligation in the United States of America to live up to who we are. America is the only—is a unique nation. We're the only nation formed based on an idea—an idea—not an ethnicity, not an ideology, not a—idea: We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men and women are created equal, et cetera.
Audience member. Yes.
The President. Well, here's the deal. Here's the deal. There are over a hundred countries in the world that have no capacity to help themselves right now. None.
And that's why—I got somewhat criticized, but that's why I've worked so darn hard—after being able to nail down, in the first 100 days, over 60 [600]* million doses of vaccine for Americans, I went to Europe to meet what they call the ""G-7"" and then with NATO and then with the EU. And I promised that the United States, in the remainder of this year and the first half of next year, is going to provide a billion doses to the rest of the world. A billion doses. A half a billion of those will be done between now and January and the first half of next year.
The point being: I wanted the Nation to reflect what you all reflect. Everyone in this room, there's everything—you—I want to thank you for all you're doing. But the rest of the world is in trouble as well. We have to look out for one another. We really do.
And what you're doing here—go back to the United States—nonprofits directing folks to where to go; houses of worship opening onsite vaccination for congregants; my friend Reverend Barber is here, as I said, and countless faith leaders whose—who are truly doing God's work; college students providing rides for seniors.
So what's happening in America is what America is all about. That's what the rest of world is looking at: Are we what we advertise ourselves to be? It's because of people like you, here in Raleigh and in communities across America, that we're going to win this fight.
Look at the progress we made so far. Today, 66 percent of all American adults have gotten at least one shot. That includes 87 percent of all seniors of all colors; 75 percent of adults ages 40 and up have gotten a shot; and 70 percent of those age 30 and up.
Nationwide, we're seeing the lowest number of daily cases and deaths since the first day of the pandemic. And we've built equity into the heart of the vaccination program. I put together a vaccination team, headed by a really bright guy, and we put together a group of 23 doctors. And what they did was, we had one doc who does nothing but deal with equity—access for people.
There's a reason why it's been harder to get African Americans, initially, to get vaccinated: because they're used to be experimented on—the Tuskegee Airmen and others. People have memories. People have long memories. It's awful hard, as well, to get Latinx vaccinated as well. Why? They're worried that they'll be vaccinated and deported.
So look, from day one, something that Governor Cooper has been totally focused on is making sure we get as many people vaccinated, particularly people who don't have access to health care usually; who don't have ordinary—don't have doctors or family physicians, et cetera.
Seventy-three percent of the shots administered at community health centers through the Federal program we have and more than 58 percent of the shots administered in federally run vaccination sites have gone to people of color. It makes a gigantic difference. And across the Nation, people of color have accounted for more than half of all the vaccinations in the last month. The more we close the racial gap in vaccination rates, the more lives we can save.
And if I can pause for one second: That's why I've called for spending billions of dollars at NIH focusing on new ways to deal with obesity, diabetes, Alzheimer, and cancer—focus just on those diseases—money that private drug companies don't have the money to invest in or the inclination to. Because guess what? In most Black communities across America and Hispanic communities, how many stores have fresh vegetables? How many stores have a—I'll go down the list. It matters. The health condition a person enters this fight over makes a big difference as to what, in fact, is going to be able to be done.
Here in North Carolina, my administration has provided $105 million from the emergency—Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, to help get people vaccinated. Working with the Governor and the mayors and county officials across the State, there are 240 personnel in the Tar Heel State just to put the needle in somebody's arm.
This has been a gigantic—a gigantic—logistical challenge not just in North Carolina, but all across America. More than 660 National Guard members have supported the COVID-19 response here in North Carolina. Over in Greensboro, we stood up the Federal vaccination site that alone has administered 135,000 shots.
The Governor and I visited one of the mobile units you're deploying to meet the people where they live. And as a result of these efforts Statewide, case deaths are down over 90 percent in the last 5 months.
All of this is great news. But here's the deal: For all the progress we've made as a country, hospitalizations and deaths are down drastically in places where people are getting vaccinated. The data couldn't be clearer: If you're vaccinated, you're safe. You are still at risk of getting seriously ill or dying if you, in fact, have not been vaccinated. That's just a fact.
And this new, dangerous variant that continues to emerge, it's now the most common variant in America and here. And unvaccinated people are incredibly vulnerable. This is a serious concern with what experts call the ""Delta"" variant. It is not only—according to the CDC, between 10 to 20 percent of all cases in the last 2 weeks have been the Delta variant.
Dr. Fauci has made it clear—he and my wife have been traveling the country to make this case—that it's more easily transmittable, this Delta variant, potentially deadlier, and especially dangerous for young people—for young people. He says it's the greatest threat to our fight to beat COVID-19.
But the good news is, we have a solution. The science is clear. The best way to protect yourself against the virus and its variants is to be fully vaccinated. It works. It's free. It's safe. It's easy. It's convenient.
Over 150 million Americans have gotten fully vaccinated, and they're safe and protected now and even including against the Delta variant. They're getting back to living their lives and spending time with their loved ones. But we need more people to get fully vaccinated to finish the job. That's why I'm here.
I called for June to be the ""Month of Action"" to get folks vaccinated so we can all enjoy a Fourth of July with our independence from the virus—from the virus. If you're already vaccinated, make sure your family and friends are vaccinated. Help them make a plan to get vaccinated.
If you've gotten your first shot, make sure you get your second one to be fully protected. It's a big deal.
Audience member. Right!
The President. And if you're not vaccinated, don't put it off any longer. Just do it.
Audience member. Yeah!
The President. Just do it. And it's never been easier. It's never been easier to do it.
Text your ZIP Code to 438829—438829. And immediately, it will pop up to find the vaccination sites closest to you. And hardly anyone is beyond 5 miles from a potential site.
Get a free ride to and from your vaccination sites. I want to publicly thank—when I asked for help, both Lyft or Uber said between the time—this last month to July 4, they'll provide a ride free to and from. They'll wait and take you back home.
Thousands of pharmacies are offering no-appointment, walk-in vaccinations. More than 1,400 pharmacies are in North Carolina that do that. They've already administered over 2.2 million shots, these pharmacies. Many of them are open 24 hours on Fridays.
So go tomorrow if you've not gotten it done. Or when you're going out, knocking on doors, tell them, ""Tomorrow, 24 hours, a majority of these drugstores are open."" Get it done. Get it done and get it done at their convenience.
And if you still have questions, that's okay. Talk to people who you know who have gotten the shot. That's what you guys are out there—going to be doing, knocking on doors. Talk to your doctor or your health provider. If you don't have one, physicians know it's the right choice to get vaccinated to protect themselves, their patients, and their communities.
And listen to North Carolina's own Dr. Kizzy Corbett, you know, from Hurdle Mills, just about an hour north from here. She's a scientist at NIH that I met several weeks ago who helped develop the COVID-19 vaccine, a vaccine that was developed after decades of research under Republican and Democratic administrations. As I said, I met her earlier this year during a tour of the NIH Vaccine Research Center where this all happened. She's incredible.
Folks, there is no reason to leave yourself vulnerable to the deadly virus for 1 single day more. And as they say in my church, I'm preaching to the choir, I know. [Laughter] But the television is recording this. [Laughter] Make the case. Let people know getting vaccinated is not only maybe going to save their lives, but save their mother, their father, their child, their son, their daughter, their coworker.
So, please, please get vaccinated. And let everyone do our part. Let's everyone do it.
This weekend, we will be hosting another nationwide canvassing event where volunteers like you are going to knock on doors and talk to their friends and neighbors and help finish the job of getting America vaccinated.
To join that effort, I say to the people watching this—because these people have already joined the effort: To join that effort, please visit wecandothis.HHS.governor—.gov, excuse me—wecandothis.HHS.gov. Sign up. Get involved. We can do this. We really can do this.
Let me close where I began. To all of you here today who are about to head out and canvass your communities: Thank you from the bottom of my heart. I genuinely mean it. But just listen again to Ivy—graduated from Apex Friendship High, just finished her first year in school. She's been spending her summer doing door-to-door—going door to help get people vaccinated to stay safe.
And I'll bet what she had to say, when asked, is what a lot of you think as well. She said, quote—I hope you don't mind my repeating this, Ivy—but she said, quote: ""Reaching out and giving back to the community is everything. I like to say . . . I don't dream of having a dream job or a dream career, but I dream of truly helping people in the best way I can . . . that's my life goal.""
This can be among one of the most important things you do. I really mean it. And again, remember—I think you're probably the least ones that have to remember—remember: 600,000-plus Americans have died—600,000-plus Americans have died. This Delta variant—you know there's going to be others as well. You know what's going to happen. We've got to get our young people vaccinated.
So talk to those moms when you knock on the door. Tell them about—tell them about—why it's so important to get their children.
You may remember, I got widely criticized when I suggested we keep dropping the age of people eligible for vaccinations. It's been based on the science. I didn't do anything based on a whim. The science, the tests show that.
And what's going to happen here, I predict, as soon as we go from temporary approval to permanent approval—which just takes time; it's not that it's—don't think it's there—it's going to increase the number of people willing to move as well.
So, Ivy, thank you for representing the best of us. Thank all of you for representing the best of us. You've all got the whole world in front of you. And you know, it's because of—it's because of people like Ivy and all of you why I have so much faith in the future.
I'm not being—you know, if you notice, I've been unfairly criticized for being optimistic. I've been fairly criticized because I think we can actually pull people together. I ran—when I ran for President, I ran for three reasons. I said, one, is restore the soul of America—just basic decency, looking out for one another.
And, two, because we had to rebuild the backbone of this country that had been so damaged, which is the middle class——
Audience member. That's right!
The President. ——working class folks and middle class folks. It was about time to build the economy from the middle up and out and from the middle class up. That's what we have to do.
Folks, let's really let this be the summer of joy and freedom. Let it really happen. Let's celebrate the Fourth of July with the independence from the virus. We can get this done. We—no, we really can get this done, and we really can do it.
But you know what? I said the third reason I was running was to unify the country.
Audience members. Yes!
The President. Well, folks, it's never been as divided as it is today—never been as divided as it is today, since the Civil War.
And, folks, it's such a waste of talent, such a waste of time. And the rest of the world is looking at us. The rest of the world is wondering whether or not can we really lead the world again. The last 4 years have been devastating to our leadership around the world. I'm not making this—but it's true.
But here's the way we lead: Like you always lead—those who lead better than I and others—you lead by example, and the example is twofold. And I'll end with this. One is making sure we do everything in our power to walk that extra mile, to knock on that door, to pick up the phone, to actually pull up in your own vehicle and take someone who needs to get to a vaccination site. Convince them. Let them know why it's so important. Let them know. Because people respond to individual relationships, even new ones. ""I got it. My brother got it. My sister got it. I took my daughter, and she got it,"" et cetera.
And secondly, let the world know that when it comes down to lifesaving initiatives, no matter where they are—but they come from us—we should share them with the world—the whole world. We're even giving some of these vaccines to nations that are not our friends, because the people are not the ones who are not our friends—the leadership.
So, folks, there's a lot we can do. As I said, I have faith in your generation. The reason I'm so optimistic is because you're the most incredible generation in American history. I'm not being solicitous. Number one, you're the least prejudiced generation in history, number one.
Number two, you volunteer than most—any other generation, including my vaulted generation of the sixties. [Laughter] You—no, I mean it. We are proud of what we did, but you volunteer.
Number three, you're the best educated generation in the history of America.
And I believe our dealing with equity is only the beginning as it relates to vaccine. The first executive order I signed was insisting that every one of my Cabinet members focus on racial equity—because we have a—we have a chance—we have a chance to make significant change in this country, and it's going to come from what you guys do. I really mean it. I can't thank you enough.
Sorry to take so much of your time, but God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you.

Remarks on Infrastructure and Jobs Legislation and an Exchange With Reporters
","
The President. Please, please be seated. I've got my notes here. Well, good afternoon. If you hear a little noise in the background, it's because I'm supposed to be getting on a helicopter to head to North Carolina, which I'm going to be doing shortly, right after this. And the Vice President and I, though, want to lay out what we've just settled, at least for the moment, with our friends, the bipartisan group of Senators.
I said many times before: There's nothing our Nation can't do when we decide to do it together, do it as one Nation. Today is the latest example of that truth, in my view. I'm pleased to report that a bipartisan group of Senators—five Democrats, five Republicans, part of a larger group—has come together and forged an agreement that will create millions of American jobs and modernize our American infrastructure to compete with the rest of the world and own the 21st century.
I want to thank them for working together and for raising their ideas and concerns with me and with the Vice President, as well as with our jobs Cabinet: Secretaries Buttigieg is here—good to see you, Mr. Secretary. Secretary Fudge. Secretary Granholm. Secretary—there you are—okay, you guys to make sure I—thought everybody was on this side. I was—[laughter]. Secretary Raimondo and Secretary Walsh.
I also want to thank Senator Shelley Capito for her earlier work on an infrastructure agreement. We didn't reach an agreement, but she tried her best to get something done. I'm sure it helped produce the final agreement we have.
Now, the fact is, investment in jobs and infrastructure have often had bipartisan support in the past. Matter of fact, when I first got to the United States Senate, it was probably the least difficult thing to do—is pass infrastructure plans. But even so, it's been a very long time since the last time our country was able to strike a major bipartisan deal on American infrastructure, which is so badly needed, I might add. We devoted far too much energy to competing with one another and not nearly enough energy competing with the rest of the world to win the 21st century.
The investments we'll be making as a result of this deal are long overdue. They'll put Americans to work in good-paying jobs repairing our roads and our bridges. They'll deliver high-speed internet to every American home, bringing down the price that people pay now for internet service. And they'll close the American digital divide—as been driven home by every mother and father with a child at home during the COVID crisis, that is, thank God, abating. And kids not being able to be in school.
This is going to put plumbers and pipefitters to work. It's going to replace a hundred percent of the Nation's lead water pipes so that every child and every American could turn on the faucet at home or at school and drink clean water, including in low-income communities and communities of color that have been disproportionately affected by lead pipes and the consequences of that.
This deal makes key investments to put people to work all across the country building transmission lines, upgrading the power grid to be more energy efficient and resilient in extreme weather—to be able to sustain extreme weather and the climate crisis. It also builds our natural infrastructure—our coastlines and our levees—to be more resilient as well.
American workers will be installing electric vehicle charging stations and undertaking critical environmental cleanups. This bipartisan agreement represents the largest investment in public transit in American history. And I might add that—the largest investment in rail, since the creation of Amtrak. You all know I have nothing but affection for Amtrak, having traveled over a million miles on it, commuting every day. But it's a big deal.
This agreement is going to create a new financing authority that's going to leverage private capital and infrastructure and clean energy projects that will provide folks with good-paying jobs that can't be outsourced—the kinds of jobs that provide middle class—a middle class life with a little bit of breathing room—a little bit of breathing room—for American families.
My dad used to say, ""Being in the middle class is just being able to take that extra breath."" I mean it sincerely. Think about it. Think about all the people who can't take that breath because they don't—they have no margin for error.
We're—and we're going to do it all without raising a cent from earners below $400,000. There's no gas tax increase, no fee on electric vehicles. And the fact is, we're going to help ensure that—we're going to make sure that everybody in America is in a position to be able to do what need be done.
And so what I've—because—and let me be clear: We're in a race with China and the rest of the world for the 21st century. They're not waiting. They're investing tens of billions of dollars across the board. Tens of billions.
I just came back from Europe with—meeting with the G-7, as well as with NATO, as well as the EU, and as well as with Mr. Putin—all separately. There's massive investment going on in the—among the autocrats. One of the underlying questions is: Can democracies compete with autocratic enterprises in the 21st century? And this is a big move toward that, being able to compete. We have to move, and we have to move fast.
And this agreement singles—signals to the world that we can function, deliver, and do significant things. These investments represent the kind of national effort that, throughout our history, has literally—not figuratively—literally transformed America and propelled us into the future. The transcontinental railroad, the Interstate Highway System—investments that we made together that only our Government was in a position to make.
Now we're poised to add a new chapter in that American tradition. Let me be clear: Neither side got everything they wanted in this deal; that's what it means to compromise. And it reflects something important: It reflects consensus. The heart of democracy requires consensus. And it's time a true—this time a true bipartisan effort, breaking the ice that too often has kept us frozen in place and prevented us from solving the real problems facing the American people.
This deal means millions of good-paying jobs, and fewer burdens felt at the kitchen table and across the country and safer and healthier communities. But it also signals to ourselves and to the world that American democracy can deliver. And because of that, it represents an important step forward for our country.
I want to be clear about something else: Today is a huge day for one-half of my economic agenda, the American Jobs Plan. It delivers on clean transportation, clear water and clean water, universal broadband, clean power infrastructure, and environmental resilience. In these areas, it invests two-thirds of the resources that I proposed in my American Jobs Plan. Two-thirds of what I called for in those areas.
But I'm getting to work with Congress right away on the other half of my economic agenda as well—the American Family Plan—to finish the job on childcare, education, the caring economy, clean energy tax cuts—clean energy, and tax cuts for American families and much more. For me, investment in our physical and human infrastructure are inextricably intertwined. Both make us better off and stronger.
The case for these investments is clear. Economists—left, right, and center—independent Wall Street forecasters, they all say that these kinds of public investments mean more jobs, more workers participating in the labor force, higher productivity, and higher growth for our economy over the long run.
Both need to get done, and I'm going to work closely with Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer to make sure that both move through the legislative process promptly and in tandem. Let me emphasize that: ""and in tandem.""
We need physical infrastructure, but we also need the human infrastructure as well. They're a part of my overall plan. What we agreed on today is what we could agree on: the physical infrastructure. There was no agreement on the rest. We're going to have to do that through the budget process. And we need a fairer tax system to pay for it all. I'm not going to rest until it all—both get to my desk.
And lastly, I know there are some of my party who discouraged me from seeking an agreement with our Republican colleagues, who said that we should, ""Go bigger and go alone."" To them, I say this: I have already shown, in my young Presidency, that I am prepared to do whatever needs to get done to move the country forward. That's what I did with the American Rescue Plan, which was $1.9 trillion.
But let me say this: When we can't—when we can find common ground, though, working across party lines, that is what I will seek to do. The reason why is because broader support for a proposal has—the broader support a proposal has in Congress, the stronger its prospects for passage. Working together when we can allows us to make bipartisan process [progress]* whenever possible without foreclosing the right and the necessity of moving forward on a major—on a majority basis when we are at deep odds with one another, so-called reconciliation progress—process.
And for the deal being announced today, there is plenty of work ahead to bring this home. It's going to require hard work and collaboration. The committee chairs and the ranking members are going to play a major part. There are going to be disagreements to resolve and more compromise to be forged along the way.
But this group of Senators and all of the American people can be proud today because we have reaffirmed, once again, that we are the United States of America. There's not a single thing beyond our capacity that we aren't able to do when we do it together.
I know a lot of you in the press, particularly, doubt that unity is possible, that anything bipartisan is possible. It's hard, but it's necessary. And it can get done.
So I want to thank you all. And God bless you. And now I'll take a few questions, before the helicopter leaves without me, from the press.
Q. Mr. President——
Infrastructure and Jobs Legislation 
Q. Mr. President, what assurances do you have at this point that you have sufficient Democratic support, both in the Senate and the House, to move both on this bipartisan deal and on the reconciliation package?
The President. You always ask me those things.
Q. Yes, sir.
The President. Nobody knows for certain. It's your job, but you know it's not a reasonable question. And the reason I say that—I'm not even being critical—the idea of my telling you now that I know what every Senator—how they're going to vote is just not—I don't know that.
I do know that among the roughly 20 bipartisan groups of Senators and Congress—Senators that I met with—only 10 were here today, but that group—that we had an agreement. For example, you know—and you know, they talk about, ""Well, why would Biden compromise?"" Well, when's the last time—if you had asked me whether or not I'd be able to get passenger rail service or 66 billion dollars' worth, largest investment ever since Amtrak came about. I asked for $90 [billion]* and got $66 billion.
Talk about public transit: $49 billion—$49 billion for public transit. When I raised that before, some of you looked at me like: ""Where have you been, Biden? You've been spending too much in China or something."" I haven't been to China.
You know, electric buses—$7.5 billion. I asked for $15 [billion].* I couldn't get all of it, but I—we compromised. Electric infrastructure—that is charging stations along the roads. I got—I asked for 15; I got 7½. These are significant down payments on things that we finally got after negotiation—skillful negotiation on the part of my Cabinet and my team, led by Mr. Ricchetti.
And so, when you ask me what guarantee do I have that I have all the votes I need: I don't have any guarantee, but what I do have is a pretty good read, over the years, of how the Congress and the Senate works. And the idea that we're not going—because someone is not going to be able to get every single thing they want, they're going to vote against some of the things that I just named with nothing in here that's, quote, ""bad"" for the environment, ""bad"" for the economy, ""bad"" for the transportation is unlikely. But I can't guarantee it. I—you know that.
Yes.
Bipartisanship/Infrastructure and Jobs Legislation/Climate Resilience/Energy Efficiency and Weatherization 
Q. Mr. President, talk a little more about your interactions with Republicans specifically. You said earlier: ""They've given me their word. Where I come from, that's good enough for me."" To skeptics in your own party, what is it about the conversations you've had recently with Republicans that gives you so much hope?
And secondly, you had said earlier you might have more to say about the situation down in South Beach, in Miami. I'm just curious——
The President. I'm going to stick to—I will, at the end, answer your South Beach question. But let me—so we have some coherence here.
Number one, I've worked with a lot of these people who are in the room. I know them. Everybody knows and you guys know: When certain Senators tell you something, they mean it. And others you take their—you discount.
Where I come from and the—in my years in the Senate, the single greatest currency you have is your word—keeping your word. Mitt Romney has never broken his word to me. You know, the Senator from Alaska and the Senator of New Hampshire, they've never broken their word—or from Maine—they've never broken their word. They're friends.
And so the people I with—was with today are people that I trust. I don't agree with them on a lot of things, but I trust them when they say: ""This is a deal. We'll stick to the deal."" Just like I doubt that you'll find any one of them who say they don't trust me when I said, ""Okay, this is the deal—on these issues, this is a deal we'll stick with.""
But, for example, there's—and I made it clear today—there's other things in the environment I want to get done. I think we should have the $300 billion tax credit for dealing with the environment. It will be a—giant tax cuts for corporations, but it will also be a giant move toward weatherizing every building in America and all the things that we need to do.
So there are things—and so, when I said, ""We agree,"" I'm not going to go back and renegotiate the Amtrak piece, but I am going to fight for trying to get $300 billion more for tax credits for the environment. That's about as best that I can answer the question.
Yes, ma'am.
Economic Stimulus Payments/Tax Relief/Education and Family Assistance Legislation/Voting Rights Legislation 
Q. Mr. President, can you answer a question—thank you so much. My question is on the timeline. There are families who are looking at the Families Plan and wondering when the help is coming. Can you talk—I know you said they're going to be ""promptly and in tandem,"" but can you say anything more about that?
And what does this signal for future deals? There's still things like voting rights and policing reform that are not able to get bipartisan deals. What does this tell you? What have you learned in talking to Republicans about what would happen in the future?
The President. Let me take—you asked three essay questions—[laughter]—and legitimate questions, but you asked three of them. The first one related to what, again?
Q. The first one is on the timeline. When do you think this two-track—[inaudible]?
The President. Timeline. And you said, ""when people are waiting for relief.""
Q. Yes.
The President. I got them——
Q. [Inaudible]
The President. ——$1.9 trillion in relief so far. They're going to be getting checks in the mail that are consequential, this week, for childcare. A lot has been happened already. Number one.
Number two, I'm going to fight like heck to get them the rest of what I think has to be done. On education, for example, my proposal was, in the Family Plan, early education and free community college. I'm going to fight like the devil to get that done, but it's not going to be with Republican help. I'm going to have to get every Democrat and do it through reconciliation if it gets done. So that's number one.
The—I think, based on my being out on the street and polling data, I think the people who need the help the most trust me to be fighting to get them the help they need. They know who I am, and they know my record.
With regard to the issue of what about voting rights——
Q. [Inaudible]
The President. Voting rights is maybe the most consequential thing, I think, with—I'm going to be going around the country, spending time making the case to the American people that this just isn't about showing an identification that this is who I am when I vote.
This isn't just about whether or not—excuse me—you can provide water for someone standing in line while they're waiting to vote. This is about who gets to judge whether your vote counted after it's been cast. Think about it.
Up to now, every State and the Federal Government has assumed that there would be officials who were appointed and/or elected in States where the election commissioners—bound by an oath that they would uphold certain requirements to make sure the vote was honest and fair.
What these guys are trying to do now, in rough approximation, is say that, ""If we don't like the vote turned out and we control the State legislature, we're going to say the vote didn't count and we're going to recount."" That's never happened before. It's wrong. ""Who in God's name,"" as my mother would say, ""died and left them boss?"" Your vote has to count when you cast it.
There's a lot of ancillary pieces of this legislation that I strongly support. I strongly support the idea that there's no prior—if I had my way, there'd be no private contributions to see who gets elected—how much money you raise. If I had my way—and I think it's really important—that every election day would be a day off because people can't go to—people who work certain shifts can't make it to the election. I would make sure there's automatic registration when you turn 18.
That's what I think everybody thinks this fight is about—and it's a worthy fight—but it's much more profound than that. It's about saying that the legislature in Georgia could decide, if it's a Republican legislature: ""You know, on reflection, we don't think that election was fair. We're going to vote to say it didn't count."" It's just simply wrong. It's wrong. And in my view, it borders on being immoral.
This is the sacred right to vote. As John Lewis said, ""It is the—the—the most important right you have."" And so I'm going to be making the case across the country and, as best I can, to see it's overturned.
Q. Mr. President, Mr. President——
Q. Mr. President, do you support critical——
The President. Let me go to this side.
Infrastructure and Jobs Legislation/Education and Family Assistance Legislation 
Q. Mr. President, you said you want both of these measures to come to you ""in tandem."" Did you receive any assurances that that would happen? And how do you anticipate—what will you do if——
The President. I control that.
Q. ——they don't get to you in time?
The President. If they don't come, I'm not signing. Real simple. [Laughter] So, but I expect—I expect that in the—the coming months this summer, before the count—the fiscal year is over, that we will have voted on this bill, as well—the infrastructure bill—as well as voted on the budget resolution.
And that's when they'll—but if only one comes to me, I'm not—and if this is the only thing that comes to me, I'm not signing it. It's in tandem.
The President's Legislative Agenda 
Q. So, Mr. President, do you support, then, Speaker Pelosi's stated plan to hold the bipartisan deal in the House until the Senate also passes reconciliation? Do you support that sequencing on her part?
The President. Yes.
Q. Mr. President, Mr. President——
Q. But, Mr. President, your own party is not on the same page about the reconciliation package. So, by moving forward with this two-track system, are you putting the bipartisan bill in jeopardy?
Infrastructure and Jobs Legislation 
The President. Sure, the bipartisan bill was—look, the bipartisan bill, from the very beginning, was understood, there was going to have to be the second part of it. I'm not just signing the bipartisan bill and forgetting about the rest I—that I proposed. I proposed a significant piece of legislation in three parts. And all three parts are equally important.
And by the way, my party—you keep—everybody tells me my party is divided. Well, my party is divided. My party is divided, but my party is also rational. If they can't get every single thing they want, but all that they have in the bill is that—before them is good, are they going to vote ""no""? I don't think so.
Q. Mr. President——
The President. Yes.
Public Debt Limit/Infrastructure and Jobs Legislation/The President's Approach to Negotiation 
Q. Mr. President, are you—48 hours ago, it seemed like this deal was in, kind of, a rough place or didn't necessarily have a path forward. What clinched it? What changed the dynamic that you saw? And also, would you be willing to include a debt ceiling increase in either of the two vehicles you're talking about?
The President. There's probably going have to be debt ceiling. Whether it's included in either of these bills is not relevant. It depends on what the leadership in the House and Senate thinks how they should proceed, number one.
Number two, you notice, I didn't have that bleak view you all had. You said, 48 hours ago, it didn't look good. It looked good to me 48 hours ago. It looked good to our team 48 hours ago. Seventy-two hours ago, it looked good too. It wasn't there yet.
But you guys know me too well. And it's—I'm going to drive you crazy the next 4 years, because I'm going to tell you the truth as I see it. I know the Senate and the House better than most of you know it. I've been—my whole life, that's what I've done.
It doesn't mean I'm going to turn out to be right all the time, but I'm not going to negotiate with the press while I'm negotiating with the—in privately with my colleagues. And these are really tough decisions Senators have got. I don't, in any way, dismiss what Senator Murphy says about the environment. I don't dismiss it at all. I just remind him: I wrote the bill on the environment. Why would I not be for it?
The question is: How much can we get done? And the bottom line is: When all is said and done, does what you agree to preclude, forever, you getting the things you really want? Well, I'm not for that. I'm not going to vote for one of those deals.
Secondly, do you get all of what you wanted? Or do you come back and fight another day? I've been President about 150 days. I think we've done fairly well so far. Not because of me, but because of the way the system works.
So it's not—I mean, I—I know that doesn't answer any of your questions about, ""Can you tell me when?"" and ""How are you going to do it?"" I just feel that the best way to get a Senator or a Congressperson who supports the essence of what's already there, but says, ""I don't have enough of what's there, of other things""—the best way to get that message across is go to the constituents and say: ""Here's what's on the table. Do you think your Senator, your Congressman should vote for that?""
So you campaign. The campaign doesn't stop; the partisan piece stops, in terms of, ""I'm against Charlie Smith or Harriet Wilson."" But that doesn't stop—I mean, that stops. But what doesn't stop is just saying, ""You're""—it's like on a—last example I'll give. I promise I won't do this to you again. But remember: In 2018, everybody said: ""Well, you know, we're going to lose. The Democrats are going to lose. You know, the House and Senate, they're not going to make—the House is not going to make gains.""
And I went into over 60 congressional districts. I didn't go after the individual Congresspersons who were against making sure that we kept the Affordable Care Act. But I went to their constituents and said, ""The Affordable Care Act is really important."" We had large crowds show up. And I'd say: ""Here's why I think you should do it. That's why, if I were you, I'd take a look at what Charlie Smith says and Harriet Wilson says. He's for it. She's not."" Or ""She's for it; he's not."" And guess what? We won, what, 40 some seats?
So, it's not just convincing this particular Congressperson. It's making a rational case, if you can, in their communities why this is important to get done.
And I think the fact that I didn't get everything now at this moment—for example, a lot of our housing pieces didn't get passed. We're coming back at it though. We're coming back at it. We're going to make the case. And if I make the case to the public at large—the one thing I can say for all of you, you do accurately report what I say. The problem is I disappoint you because I can't answer all your questions and negotiate with you before I negotiate with my colleagues.
But I really think we—the public understands, and they're seeing the proof is in what's happening. It's now projected our economy is going to grow above 7 percent this year. Projections from Wall Street to the Fed: It's going to continue to grow. We're going to increase more—and guess what?
Remember you were asking me—and I'm not being critical of you all; I really mean this. It was legitimate questions you were asking me—asking me: ""Well, you know, guess what? Employers can't find workers."" I said: ""Yes. Pay them more."" This is an employee's bargaining chip now, what's happening. They're going to have to compete and start playing [paying]* hard-working people a decent wage.
And by the way—talking inflation—the overwhelming consensus is it's going to pop up a little bit and then go back down. No one is talking about, ""This great, great deal.""
So, again, if it turns out that what I've done so far—what we've done so far is a mistake, it's going to show. It's going to show. The economy is not going to grow, like it wasn't before. People aren't going to have jobs with increased pay, like it was before. People are going to be out of work, like it was before, with no options. Unemployment is going to continue to climb, instead of continue to go down. If that happens, then my policies didn't make a lot of sense, but I'm counting on it not. That's my counting how it's working.
I've got to get a helicopter—[inaudible]. Thanks again.
Collapse of the Champlain Towers South Condominium Building in Surfside, Florida/Federal Assistance 
Q. Mr. President, will you travel to Florida, sir?
Q. Can we ask you about Florida—what you've learned and what you've—[inaudible]?
The President. Oh, yes. I apologize. Yes, thank you. [Laughter] Madame Vice President. I've spoken with, coincidentally, the mayor of Miami-Dade was in my office yesterday. And I talked to her today—not about that, obviously—and so I had a long discussion with her today.
I've also spoken with—we've been in contact with the Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who has that district. We've gotten in touch with FEMA. They're ready to go. The Governor is going to have to—we can't—they're—they're down inspecting in what is—what they think is needed. But I'm waiting for the Governor to ask for—declare an emergency if—and especially as we learn more about what the rest—might happen with the rest of the building.
So we are on top of it. We are ready to move, from the Federal resources, immediately—immediately, if in fact we're asked for it. But we can't go in and do it—now, but the—FEMA is down there taking a look at what's needed, and—including from everything from—if the rest of those buildings have to be evacuated as well; finding housing for those people; making sure they have the capacity to both have a place to shelter and food to eat, et cetera.
So that's underway now, and I'm—my Chief of Staff has been deeply involved in this from the very beginning. We've got the Cabinet involved in it now, in terms of dealing with FEMA. We're working on it. And I made it clear that I say to the people of Florida: Whatever help you want that the Federal Government can provide, we're waiting. Just ask us; we'll be there. We'll be there.
So thank you so much. I appreciate it.
Vice President Kamala D. Harris's Visit to the Mexico-U.S. Border 
Q. Mr. President, one quick question—what are you hoping the Vice President can do at the border tomorrow?
The President. She's done a great job so far. And the reason why it's important that she go down: She's now set up the criteria, having spoken with the President of Mexico and Guatemala, visited the region to know what we need to do.
Thank you very much.
Evacuation of Afghan Interpreters and Other Service Contractors Who Assisted With U.S. Military Operations in Afghanistan 
Q. Do you know anything on these reports about moving Afghan nationals to other countries who helped during the war?
The President. They're going to come. We've already begun the process. Those who helped us are not going to be left behind.
Q. Do you know what country they're going to move to first?
The President. I don't know that. I'll be meeting with the—with Ghani tomorrow, the head—he's coming to my office. That will be a discussion. But they're welcome here, just like anyone else who risked their lives to help us.
Q. Thank you, sir.
Q. Any more—any more——

Remarks Following a Meeting With Senators on Infrastructure and Jobs Legislation and an Exchange With Reporters
","
The President. I actually like the bill.
Q. We know you do.
Q. Do you have a deal?
Q. Do we have a deal?
Q. How did it go, sir?
The President. Let me get everybody out here. Come on—let me. Rob and—come on. Everybody, come on up.
We had a really good meeting. And to answer your direct question, we have a deal. And I think it's really important—we've all agreed that none of us got what we—all that we wanted. I clearly didn't get all I wanted. They gave more than, I think, maybe they were inclined to give in the first place.
But this reminds me of the days we used to get an awful lot done up at the United States Congress. We actually worked with one—[laughter]—we had bipartisan deals. Bipartisan deals means compromise.
One of the things that I've made clear: I've signed on—and I'm going to let them give you the detail because—and you can ask them—and I'm—I will talk to you all later, in the next hour or two. But I promise you I'm not going away.
But one of the things that we agreed on: infrastructure. We made serious compromises on both ends. There is—and they'll give you the numbers. But we did not—they did not—and I understand their position—Republicans and this group did not want to go along with my—any of my Family Plan issues, the childcare tax credits, the human infrastructure that I talk about.
And that—we'll see what happens in the reconciliation bill and the budget process—if that—if we can get some compromise there. And if we can't, see if I can attract all the Democrats to a position that is there. But we're going to—they're going to move on a dual track. And that's about all I'll say.
But I want to thank each and every one of them. It's been—you know, a lot of us go back a long way, where we're used to doing one thing: Give each other our word, and that's the end. Nobody questions it. They have my word, I'll stick with what they proposed, and they've given me their word as well. So, where I come from, that's good enough for me.
So I'm going to turn it over to the two chairs here. And I'll talk to you all a little bit later.
Collapse of the Champlain Towers South Condominium Building in Surfside, Florida 
Q. Have you been briefed about the building collapse in Miami?
The President. I have. I've spoken with the mayor. I've spoken with the Congresswoman. And I'll have more to say about that as well.
Senate Negotiations on Infrastructure and Jobs Legislation/Bipartisanship 
Q. Mr. President, what does it mean that you were able to reach this deal?
Q. Are you committed to the two-track system, Mr. President?
The President. Pardon me?
Q. Are you committed to the two-track system?
The President. That is—there is going to be a two-track system.
Q. And are you confident that you're going to have all of the Democrats' support it in the Senate?
The President. Let them talk to you. Okay? I'm not confident in anything except, I trust their word. [Laughter]

Remarks on Gun Crime Prevention Strategy and an Exchange With Reporters
","
Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. Good afternoon, Mr. President. It's good to be here with you and with local elected and community leaders and with representatives of law enforcement.
Protecting our communities from violent crime is a top priority for the Department of Justice and one of our most important responsibilities. I'm glad the President brought us together today to discuss a subject of such importance to the public we serve. As our participants in today's roundtable have noted, the increase in violent crime in 2020 and early 2021 is deeply troubling.
That is why, last month, the Justice Department launched a comprehensive violent crime reduction strategy. This strategy is built around four principles: setting strategic enforcement priorities; fostering trust with and earning legitimacy in our communities; investing in community-based prevention and intervention programs; and measuring the results of these efforts through a decrease in violent crime, not merely by arrests and convictions, as if they were ends in themselves.
Now, we know that the lion's share of violent crime reduction work is shouldered by our State, local, Tribal, and Territorial law enforcement partners. Core to our strategy is targeted support of the critical work that you will be doing in the weeks and months ahead.
Every one of our U.S. attorney's offices is working with its local partners to establish an immediate plan to address the spike in violent crime that typically occurs during the summer. And the law enforcement components of the Department are making enhanced resources available to help prevent and disrupt violent crime and to focus on the most dangerous, most violent offenders.
The Department is also strengthening our Project Safe Neighborhoods, our cornerstone initiative that brings together law enforcement and community stakeholders to develop solutions to pressing violent crime problems.
Community-led efforts are vital to preventing violence before it occurs. The Justice Department has available over $1 billion in funding through over a dozen grant programs that can be used to support evidence-based, community violence intervention strategies.
And I want to say that's what I found particularly useful in our discussion just a few minutes ago, was the fact that there are such evidence-based programs available. And I'm hoping that you will get together with us so that we can spread those across the country, as well, of course, funding your own.
A properly functioning criminal justice system is essential to our efforts as well. The Department has grant funding available to help cities resume court operations and services that were curtailed during the COVID-19 pandemic. That includes funding for technology and equipment for courts to address the backlog of cases and enhance access to justice.
We know that an effective violent crime reduction strategy must also address the illegal trafficking of firearms and focus on keeping guns out of the wrong hands. And so the Department is delivering on the promises we made here at the White House in April.
On May 7, we issued a proposed rule to help address the proliferation of ghost guns. On June 7, we issued a proposed rule to clarify that pistols equipped with certain stabilizing braces are subject to the same statutory restrictions as easily concealable, short-barreled rifles. And on the same day, the Department published model Extreme Risk Protection Order legislation for States to consider as they craft their own laws to reduce gun violence.
We are now taking further steps. First, we will hold gun dealers that break the rules accountable for their actions. Most federally licensed firearms dealers operate legally in selling guns to individuals who have passed background checks. But those dealers that willfully violate the law increase the risk that guns will fall into the wrong hands.
Absent extraordinary circumstances, ATF will initiate proceedings to revoke the licenses of dealers that willfully violate the law by failing to conduct required background checks, falsifying records, failing to respond to trace requests, refusing to permit ATF to conduct inspections, or transferring firearms to persons who are prohibited from owning them.
Second, we are seeking funding to increase ATF's dealer inspection capacity and improve its effectiveness. ATF has very limited inspection resources. The President's fiscal 2022 budget requests resources to add inspection positions in every field division. The effectiveness of the enforcement program depends on the ability to identify and focus on those dealers that pose the greatest risk to public safety. Starting today, ATF will make clear to investigators in every field division that, as they prioritize inspections, they must consider the extent to which firearms sold by a dealer are later used in criminal activity.
Third, we will improve information sharing with State, local, Tribal, and Territorial partners to help bring more intelligence and law enforcement resources to bear, as well as with the public, to increase our own accountability.
Today, ATF has a point of contact in every field division to receive information from mayors, police chiefs, and other local leaders about firearms dealers they believe are acting unlawfully. And starting next month, ATA—ATF will begin sharing inspection data with the 16 States that license or regulate firearms dealers themselves. Also beginning next month, ATF will publicly post information about inspection frequency and outcomes disaggregated by field division, providing for enhanced transparency and accountability.
Fourth, we are launching a concerted effort to crack down on gun traffickers. Yesterday the Department announced that it will establish five new cross-jurisdictional law enforcement strike forces within the next 30 days. The strike forces will focus on addressing significant firearms trafficking corridors that fuel violence in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay Area, and Washington, DC, as well as in cities and towns along the way.
The Justice Department's violent crime reduction strategy and our initiatives to stem the rising tide of illegal guns will save lives. But these steps alone will not solve the problem of violent crime. Success depends on all of us joining together: those of you in this room, the many like you across the country who are working to keep their communities safe, and the people of our communities themselves.
I would now like to introduce President Biden, who has emphasized the importance of this issue and who has my gratitude for gathering us together today.
Thank you.
The President. Thank you, General. Let me—before I begin, thank the participants in our roundtable today: two mayors—three mayors, chiefs of police, attorneys general, and community organizers who have been doing significant work in bringing down violent crime in their communities. There is no one answer that fits everything. And it's about being engaged and multiple organizations being engaged.
So I want to thank you for the time you spent with us today. And I warned you: I'm coming back at you again for more information. [Laughter]
And we just met, as a I said, with a bipartisan group of mayors, law enforcement, and community leaders. And we discussed a comprehensive strategy that I'm releasing today to combat the epidemic of gun violence and other violent crime that we've been seeing in our country for far too long, that has spiked since the start of the pandemic over a year ago.
Crime has—historically rises during the summer. And as we emerge from this pandemic with the country opening back up again, the traditional summer's—summer spike may even be more pronounced than it usually would be.
For folks at home, here's what you need to know: I've been at this a long time, and there are things we know that work that reduce gun violence and violent crime and things that we don't know about. But things we know about: Background checks for purchasing a firearm are important; a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines—no one needs to have a weapon that can fire over 30, 40, 50, even up to 100 rounds unless you think the deer are wearing Kevlar vests or something; community policing and programs that keep neighborhoods safe and keep folks out of trouble.
These efforts work. They save lives. But over time, these policies were gutted and are woefully underfunded. In our conversation today, we talked about our strategy to supercharge what works while we continue to push the Congress to act on sensible gun violence legislation.
First, we discussed cracking down, as you heard from the Attorney General, on rogue gun dealers. We know that if there is a strict enforcement of background checks, then fewer guns get into the hands of criminals. Background checks have thus far kept more than 3 million guns out of the hands of felons—convicted felons, fugitives, domestic abusers, and others prohibited from being able to purchase a gun. And there are still too many loopholes in that system.
And today, enough rogue gun dealers feel like they can get away with selling guns to people who aren't legally allowed to own them. And I might add: The Second Amendment, from the day it was passed, limited the type of people who could own a gun and what type of weapon you could own. You couldn't buy a cannon.
Those who say the blood of—""the blood of patriots,"" you know, and all the stuff about how we're going to have to move against the Government. Well, the tree of liberty is not watered with the blood of patriots. What's happened is that there have never been—if you wanted or if you think you need to have weapons to take on the Government, you need F-15s and maybe some nuclear weapons. The point is that there has always been the ability to limit—rationally limit—the type of weapon that can be owned and who can own it.
The last time we had data on this issue of who is purchasing guns was more than 20 years ago. Five percent of gun dealers—it turns out, in the study we did—showed that 90 percent of illegal guns were found at the crime scenes sold by 5 percent of gun dealers. Five percent sold 90 percent of the guns found at crime scenes.
And the—these merchants of death are breaking the law for profit. They're selling guns that are killing innocent people. It's wrong. It's unacceptable. And as the Attorney General said, we're going to crack down on those gun dealers and the violent criminals they knowingly arm.
In April, I announced that the Justice Department is going to be issuing an annual report on gun trafficking so we can update that data. Today the Department is announcing, as I just did, a major crackdown on—to stem the flow of guns used to commit violent crimes. It's zero tolerance for gun dealers who willfully violate key existing laws and regulations. Let me repeat: zero tolerance.
If you willfully sell a gun to someone who is prohibited from possessing it, if you willfully fail to run a background check, if you willfully falsify a record, if you willfully fail to cooperate with the tracing requests or inspections, my message to you is this: We'll find you, and we will seek your license to sell guns. We'll make sure you can't sell death and mayhem on our streets. It's an outrage. It has to end, and we'll end it. Period.
Second, we discussed disrupting illegal gun trafficking. Now, the gun lobby wants you to believe that cities that are the toughest gun—have the toughest gun laws still have the highest rates of gun violence, as was pointed out by the group we had today in our roundtable. They—the violence is so—they argue, ""Why do you need those gun laws if they don't work in cities that have tough laws?"" Don't believe it.
Here's the truth: Today's conversation with Mayor Scott of Baltimore, for example, echoed what we know to be the case, and you hear it from mayors across the country. Mayors have the power to help shape and enforce the laws in their cities, but they can't control the laws in neighboring cities and States, even though the gun legally bought there is—often ends up in their streets. Mayor Scott says that 80 percent of the guns in Baltimore were acquired outside the city—outside the city. There's little he can do about that, so we have to act.
As part of our strategy, the Justice Department is creating five new strike forces to crack down on illegal gun trafficking in the corridors supplying weapons to cities like New York; Chicago; Los Angeles; Washington, DC; and the Bay Area. With these strike forces, local and Federal law enforcement and prosecutors are going to be able to better coordinate the prosecution of illegal gun trafficking across city and State lines, so illegal guns sold from the back door of a gun shop in Virginia don't end up at a murder scene in Baltimore. And if they do, then local and Federal law enforcement can better coordinate to trace illegal gun sales back to the shady gun dealer and hold them accountable.
Police Chief Murray of the Baltimore—excuse me, Police Chief Merritt—Police Chief Murphy Paul of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, talked about how he's coordinating more closely with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, the ATF, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the FBI, to help take on criminal organizations committing violent crimes in the city. This kind of coordination is essential to keeping the weapons of war out of the hands of dangerous criminals, fugitives, and gangs, as well as organized crime.
Third, we discussed historic funding—the—we discussed historic funding for States, cities, and counties, and Tribes for law enforcement and crime prevention. You know, they've not only had to fight this pandemic, they've also had to deal with economic crisis that has decimated their budgets, forced them to cut essential services, including law enforcement and social services.
And amid the COVID-19 pandemic, they've had to deal with a second public health crisis: gun violence. The American Rescue Plan, which we passed in the first hundred days of my administration, is providing much-needed, historic relief to bring back those law enforcement jobs and social service jobs.
Much of this relief has already arrived. The rest is on its way. And we're now providing more guidance on how they can use the $350 billion nationally that the American Rescue Plan has available to help reduce crime and address the root causes. For example, cities experiencing an increase in gun violence were able to use the American Rescue Plan dollars to hire police officers needed for community policing and to pay their overtime.
Mayors will also be able to buy crime-fighting technologies, like gunshot detection systems, to better see and stop gun violence in their communities. They can use the funding to scale up wraparound services for the residents as well, including substance abuse and mental health services that we know will make a difference to prevention of crime.
Here's another example that reminds me of the old saying my mom used to use. She'd say, ""An idle mind is the devil's workshop."" Well, school's out for the summer. Teenagers are in tough neighborhoods, no—who are in tough neighborhoods—no jobs, more trouble.
We know summer job training—summer jobs, training, and recreation for young people work. They help make sure young people pick up a paycheck instead of a pistol. One study found a Boston summer jobs program for youth reduction reduced violent crimes by 35 percent in Boston. Another study found that a program that offers high school students in Chicago a good summer job and an adult mentor and behavioral therapy led to a 45-percent drop in violence.
We can invest in more of these programs with the American Rescue Plan. And here's another thing States, cities, counties, and Tribes can do with that funding: When someone finishes their time in prison, they can't just give them—we can't just continue to give them 25 bucks and a bus ticket. They end up right back where they started and got them in trouble in the first place—or no option for being able to provide for access to public housing or for schools or for mentors to help them find their way and the stuff that prevents recidivism and helps them integrate in a society. That's changing with guidance we're issuing today.
The American Rescue Plan funding can help formerly incarcerated people get skills training, apprenticeships, and work experience so they can gain stability and security and a chance for a better life, rather than going back to exactly what they left.
Attorney General Grewal of New Jersey and Mayor Daniel—and Mayor Daniella Levine Cava of Miami-Dade talked about their efforts to lift up those kinds of—their—the kinds of community programs that reduce gun violence, keep communities safe, and make real, positive difference in people's lives.
And for folks at home, the American Rescue Plan, which is a once-in-a-generation investment to reduce violence in America, is available. I'm proud of it. It means more police officers, more nurses, more counselors, more social workers, more community violence interrupters to help resolve issues before they escalate into crimes.
It means we go after the people who flood our streets with guns and the bad actors who decide to use them to further terrorize the communities. It means saving lives. And Congress should in no way take away this funding. It's already been appropriated.
In fact, a few weeks ago, the bipartisan United States Conference of Mayors, the National League of Cities, National Association of Counties—they all came out forcefully against efforts to reclaim American Rescue Plan funds that have already been allocated to the States, cities, and counties, and Tribes. This is not a time to turn our backs on law enforcement or our communities.
Fourth, we discussed the need to support community violence intervention. These are local programs that utilize trusted messengers and community members and leaders to work directly with people who are most likely to commit gun crimes or become victims of gun crimes.
We know who they are. They intervene before it's too late, these interrupters: turn down the temperature, halt the cycle of retaliation, connect people to social services. And it works. Community violence intervention programs have shown a reduction in violence of up to 60 percent in many places.
We heard from two community leaders that do this work. Eddie, thank you for coming from Chicago to—you're really—quite frankly, it was impressive—your presentation. And DeVone Boggan from Richmond, California.
Eddie was formerly incarcerated for gun homicide, and DeVone lost his brother to gun violence. And Eddie worked as a violence interrupter. Now he runs a program that provides high-risk men with cognitive behavioral therapy to help them react to the impulses by slowing down rather than following through on the violence. It puts them in—he puts them in paid jobs to change their trajectory. The program has reduced shootings by 40 percent.
DeVone runs a program across California and six other States that enroll high-risk individuals in peace fellowships, complete with intensive mentoring and social services. It's saving lives. In Sacramento, for example, 91 percent of participants stayed away from gun violence.
States and cities should invest the American Rescue Plan funds in those kinds of anti-violent crime programs. And today I'm announcing that the White House will be working with 15 jurisdictions that are doing exactly that—from Baltimore to Baton Rouge, and Memphis to Minneapolis—to build up their community violence intervention programs, starting this summer.
And Mayor Steve Allender of Rapid City, South Dakota—a Republican and a former chief of police himself—joined us today and will be a part of this effort to help disrupt cycles of crime and violence in his community and nearby Tribal communities. We need more mayors to follow, and I'm going to be pushing to keep—pushing for more of these proven programs, which are part of the American Jobs Plan and my budget.
Fifth, and I'll close with this: We talked about the lives we lost—have already been lost and the lives that we can save. We talked about how much pain and loss so many people have experienced and so many people have now accepted as their fate here in America.
We have an opportunity to come together now—as Democrats and Republicans, as fellow Americans—to fulfill the first responsibility of government and our democracy: to keep each other safe. Enough. That means Congress passing sensible gun prevention, violence prevention initiatives is—makes sense: background checks, ban on assault weapons, repeal of the liability shield for gun manufacturers.
It means the Senate reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act—my proudest legislative accomplishment—to close the so-called ""boyfriend loophole""—its ""boyfriend and stalking loophole""—to keep guns out of the hands of abusers. We added the provision saying, ""If you have a stay-away order—you are stalking someone, and you're told it has to stop—you can't own a weapon."" Every single month, an average of 57 women are shot and killed by an intimate partner. We can help stop that.
It means confirming my outstanding nominee for—to lead the AFT—excuse me, the ATF: David Chipman. It's been without a leader for a while. The top job has been unconfirmed for much too long. A career and distinguished ATF official for 25 years, David is eminently qualified for the job that we desperately need to fill.
As Vice President, I pushed hard to lift the freeze on gun violence research at the C—the Center for Disease Control, the CDC. Guess what? Why should they not be able to study gun violence and what causes it? But there's been a block on it. I want to unfreeze that. As President, my budget doubles funding for the gun violence research at the CDC and the National Institutes of Health—the NIH—to study gun violence as a public health threat that it is.
And while we keep pushing there, Vice President Harris and I also—and our entire administration are continuing to be—will continue taking action where we can. Let's stop the proliferation of ghost guns, as we announced back in April with the Attorney General.
We need to support the development of smart gun technologies. This doesn't affect responsible gun owners or Second Amendment rights. It helps keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them in the first place, from a child who accidentally picks up a—picks it up, to a burglar or a violent criminal trying to steal it and use it.
And we need to keep building on the gun violence and crime-prevention strategy we're laying out today. Folks, this shouldn't be a red or blue issue, it's an American issue. We're not changing the Constitution; we're enforcing it, being reasonable. We're taking on the bad actors doing bad and dangerous things to our communities and to our country.
Talk to most responsible gun owners and hunters. They'll tell you there's no possible justification for having a hundred rounds in a magazine of a gun. Like I've said before: What do you think, the deer are wearing Kevlar vests? Responsible gun owners will tell you that there are too many people today who are able to buy a gun but shouldn't be able to buy a gun.
And these kinds of reasonable reforms have overwhelming support from the American people, including gun owners. The bottom line is this: Let's show the world and show ourselves that democracy works and that we can come together as one Nation. We can do this and save lives.
So thank you, God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.
And again, I thank you all for participating. But the bad news for you all is, I'm coming back. I need your continued help. So thank you very, very much.
And, General, thank you. Appreciate it.
Q. Mr. President——
Gun Control Legislation 
Q. Mr. President, are you still holding out hope that Congress can pass another assault weapons ban?
The President. I never give up hope.
Infrastructure and Jobs Legislation 
Q. How do you feel about the bipartisan infrastructure deal that's been released?
The President. I'll tell you that when I get the final numbers tonight.
Gun Violence Prevention Efforts/Social Services in Vulnerable Communities 
Q. Mr. President, what do you feel is the most effective thing that government can do to change the mindset of those who feel compelled to pull the triggers of these guns?
The President. By being engaged in a whole range of programs. We talked today—everything from mental health programs to engaging people early on and letting them know there is other options. Making sure that when a child is young, they have access to a real education, and they get started off on the right foot.
Making sure that when someone gets out of prison, they're not denied public housing, they don't have to go back under the bridge where they were living before; that they're able to get help for health care, et cetera, and reengaging them in the neighborhood, giving them some hope, some opportunity. And in the meantime, making sure that those folks who are taking advantage of them by taking advantage of their situation are, in fact, held accountable.
Thank you all so much.
Voting Rights Legislation 
Q. Once you take care of the voting rights bill, do you think it's time to reform the filibuster?
The President. I think it's time to pass the voting rights bill. [Laughter]

Remarks at the Funeral Ceremony for Former Senator John W. Warner III
","
Reverend Hollerith; distinguished clergy; Members of the Congress and our military; distinguished guests, Jeanne, Virginia, John, Mary, and Andrew, and the Warner family: It's a great honor to be invited to speak a few moments about John.
A few days after John's passing, I visited Arlington National Cemetery on Memorial Day—a sacred place on a solemn day when we undertake the fundamental act of remembrance. And amid the moments that I was there and the monuments of stone, we remember each marker represented a precious life. We remember the heroes of the greatest generation the world has ever known and that bears a noble name—the United States of America—the only nation founded on an idea that we're all created equal, ""endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable Rights,"" including, ""Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness""; and a democracy that is the very soul of our Nation and that must be defended at all costs, a soul embodied by all those patriots buried in Arlington and the fields across the world and by our dear friend, John Warner.
Like many here, I had the privilege of serving with John for three decades in the United States Senate. While we represented different political parties, I can say without hesitation John was a man of conscience, character, and honor, with a deep commitment to God and country.
Enlisted in the Navy—in the United States Navy at age 17 to fight in World War II. A few years later, enlisted in the Marine Corps to fight in Korea. Eventually named Secretary of the Navy by President Nixon, then elected to the United States Senate, where he became a towering and respected voice on foreign policy, national security, and defense; the second longest serving Senator from Virginia and the longest serving Republican.
A member of the Greatest Generation, and as that, he understood that democracy is more than a form of government; democracy is a way of being. He understood it begins and grows in an open heart and with the willingness to work across the aisle and come together in common cause.
And that empathy—empathy—is the fuel of democracy, the willingness to see each other as opponents, not as enemies. Above all, to see each other as fellow Americans even when we disagree. From John's perspective, especially when we disagreed. That's how John forged consensus and made sure our system worked and delivered for the people. I saw it time and again on issues of war and peace. John opposing torture and ending gun violence; on protecting the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary.
John's decisions were always guided by his values, by his convictions, and never by personal political consequences. And he was always guided by his obligation to all those he represented, even those who did not vote for him.
Every Senator wears the pride of his or her State on their sleeve, but John's love for the people of Virginia was something special. And they loved him back and kept reelecting him because they knew John understood the job of Senator was bigger than himself. It was about more than just John.
And as we say in the Senate, ""Excuse me a point of personal privilege"": When John endorsed me for President last year, it carried an extra meaning for me. The Senators and Congresspersons here will understand this. It wasn't merely that a prominent Republican endorsed me; when John endorsed me, it gave me confidence, not about winning, about being able to do the job. John gave me confidence.
You know, in the battle for the soul of America today, John Warner is a reminder of what we can do when we come together as one Nation. While we've never made real the full promise of America to all Americans, John's life is a reminder that every generation—every generation—has opened the door of opportunity a little bit wider. Every one.
And the mission handed down generation to generation is the work of perfecting the Union, a mission he now leaves us with a way forward. That's the power of remembrance. It lies not just in our history, but in our hope for the future. Not just in our solace, but in our strength. It lies in our hearts to continue the work of democracy—the work of our time, of all time, and the work of John's whole life.
To John's Senate staff: Thank you for your service and for all you'll do to carry on John's legacy. And to his family—Jeanne, Virginia, John, Mary, Andrew—Jill [and]* I know it hurts to remember. Sometimes, it just hurts to remember. But it's also the way to heal, to remember.
The Bible teaches, ""Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted."" While comfort can be a long time in coming, I promise you it will come. It will give you purpose in his memory, in his love for you, in his love for this country.
Virginia, I know you'll be reciting your father's favorite poem, a sort of an anthem. Here's another one that describes him so well, in my view, that means a great deal to my family and to me. It's called ""American Anthem"":
The work and prayers of centuries have brought us to this day,
What shall be our legacy? What will our children say?
Let me know in my heart when my days are through,
America, America, I gave my best to you.
John Warner gave his best to America and, to the best of my knowledge, to everybody he had a relationship with. May God bless him. He was a good man, a great American. It was an honor to have known him and worked with him.

Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Deanne B. Criswell and Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall
","
The President. Well, our FEMA Director—Administrator is here today. We're going to talk about was the severe weather patterns we're facing which keeps—likely to increase every year. And I want to make sure that we're in a position to be able to help Americans all across the country and in all our jurisdictions as these severe weather incidents increase.
The last few days alone, we've seen droughts and wildfires in the West, and we've seen tornadoes in Illinois, flooding in the South and the Mid-Atlantic. And extreme weather doesn't confine itself, as you all know, to State lines. These crises require proactive Federal response. It's just not just the States responding.
And I know that your team, Administrator, is going to raise—be faced with a lot of challenges this year, more than most. And not that you're not used to it, but it's going to—this time, it's the whole country.
And we've already stepped up this year to help vaccinate the American people and respond to the—and—but now we have to respond to these brutal storms and more severe storms and fires that extend into longer seasons throughout the year. And we're going to bring every resource to bear to be prepared, to respond, and to help people recover, but it's a big job.
And we're making sure FEMA and other frontline agencies have what they need to continue getting the job done. And I insist on being ready for whatever comes our way. That's what this is all about. And that's what we're here today about. And I'll be hosting a meeting next week with Western Governors and FEMA and the Cabinet members to prepare for heat, drought, and wildfires in the West.
And so I want to thank everybody for being here today. And let me just say one other thing. You know, I was talking with my staff a moment ago in the office about wildfires. And you know, the thing I know a little bit about is the fire service. And there's an old expression: God made man, and then he made a few firefighters. They are—they have the higher incidence of severe injuries than police officers do. They are incredibly, incredibly brave, what they do: They run to the fire.
And I just realized—I didn't realize this, I have to admit—that Federal firefighters get paid $13 an hour. That's going to end in my administration. That's a ridiculously low salary to pay Federal firefighters. Not that many Federal firefighters, but—and they—and I know you use all the resources, including State and local firefighters.
But, any rate, that's we're going to talk about today. And we're going to be brought up to date on what we can expect this season. And many of you have covered what's already happened. And the drought in the West is just astounding, when you take a look at it. Fires have already started and flooding.
So we're in for a tough season, but I think we've got to be prepared and have every resource available to make sure we're there for the American people.
Thank you all so very much.
Q. Mr. President, on voting rights, is this end? Is it over?
The President. Thank you.
Q. On voting rights, sir. Do you think it's over?
Q. Thank you, sir.

Remarks on the COVID-19 Response and National Vaccination Efforts and an Exchange With Reporters
","
The President. Good afternoon.
[At this point, the President cleared his throat.]
Excuse me. I'm pleased to announce that today we will have reached the mark of 300 million shots in the arms in just 150 days. Let me say that again: 300 million shots in arms in under 150 days.
Now, it's an important milestone that just didn't happen on its own or by chance. It took the ingenuity of American scientists, the full capacity of American companies, and a whole-of-Government response across Federal, State, Tribal, and local governments. Together, we built an unparalleled vaccination program and managed one of the biggest and most complicated logistical challenges in American history. And above all, we got here because of the American people stepping up and getting vaccinated—helping family, friends, neighbors get vaccinated.
And just remember what the situation was like 150 days ago. We didn't have enough vaccine supply for all Americans. We didn't have the vaccine infrastructure or the people to administer the vaccines or the places where the people could get vaccinated. But we turned it around together by acting quickly and aggressively and equitably.
We secured enough vaccine supply for every American. And as I announced last week during my visit to Europe, we are now in a position to provide more than one-half billion vaccine doses to the rest of the world, the hundred poorest nations.
We've developed and deployed over 9,000 Federal personnel, including 5,100 Active Duty military, to support the vaccine effort and to get shots into arms. And now we have more than 81,000 vaccination sites across the country, including over 42,000 local pharmacies.
Thanks to this wartime response, we've gotten 300 million shots in the arms of Americans in 150 days, months ahead of what most anyone thought was possible when we started. In fact, if you remember, a lot of people were skeptical that we could even get 100 million shots in my first 100 days into people's arms. But we did it. We kept going. And what we're seeing is a truly American accomplishment.
Sixty-five percent—65 percent—of American adults have gotten at least one shot, including 87 percent of our seniors. Just 5 months ago, we were at only 5 percent of adult Americans. Fifteen States and the District of Columbia have now reached at least 70 percent vaccination rate in their State. Twenty-six States and DC have fully vaccinated——
[The President cleared his throat.]
——excuse me—50 percent or more of the adults. Nationwide, we have the lowest number of daily deaths since the first days of the pandemic.
And we've built equity into the heart of our vaccination program from day one. Seventy-three percent of the shots administered at community health centers through the Federal program and more than 58 percent of the shots administered by federally run vaccination sites have gone to people of color. And across the Nation, people of color have accounted for more than half of all vaccinations in the last month. That's important progress, but we have much more to do.
Vice President Harris is, as I speak—is in Atlanta, getting the word out about the vaccinations. Yesterday I signed a bill——
[The President cleared his throat.]
——excuse me—into law making Juneteenth a Federal holiday. And this weekend, folks in communities across the country are going to be canvassing and hosting events to encourage their families, friends, and neighbors to get vaccinated. The more we close the racial gap in vaccination rates, the more lives we'll save.
And as our vaccination program is saying—saving tens of thousands of lives, with that count growing each day, it's also allowing millions of Americans to get back to living their lives: grandparents hugging their kids; kids back to school and getting ready for the summer; people going out to restaurants and traveling; businesses are reopening. Folks, we're heading into a very different summer compared to last year. A bright summer. Prayerfully, a summer of joy.
But as I promised you from the beginning, I will always give it to you straight: the good, the bad, and the truth. And the truth is that deaths and hospitalizations are drastically down in places where people are getting vaccinated. But unfortunately, cases and hospitalizations are not going down in many places in the lower vaccination-rate States. They're actually going up in some places.
A few days ago, we crossed 600,000—600,000—Americans dead from COVID, more than every death in World War I, World War II, Vietnam, and 9/11 combined. So even while we're making incredible progress, it remains a serious and deadly threat.
And the data is clear: If you are unvaccinated, you're at risk of getting seriously ill or dying or spreading it. People getting seriously ill and being hospitalized due to COVID-19 are those who have not been fully vaccinated. The new variant will leave unvaccinated people even more vulnerable than they are a month ago—over a month ago.
This is a serious concern, especially because of what experts are calling the ""Delta"" virus—the ""Delta"" variant. It's a variant that is more easily transmissible, potentially deadlier, and particularly dangerous for young people. But the good news is, we have the solution. The science and the data are clear: The best way to protect yourself against these variants are to get fully vaccinated.
So, please, please, if you have one shot, get the second shot as soon as you can so you're fully vaccinated. And if you haven't gotten vaccinated yet, get vaccinated now. Now. Don't put it off. It's free. It's easy. It's convenient.
And as I said many times, text your ZIP Code to the numbers 438829—438829—to find the sites where you can get vaccinated closest to you. Get your free Uber or Lyft ride to and from vaccination sites. I want to thank Uber and Lyft for their cooperation.
Use the extended hours at thousands of pharmacies in June, including thousands that are open 24/7 on Friday this month. Most pharmacies now offer walk-in vaccinations. No appointment is needed. Employers with less than 500 employees: The Federal Government is providing you a tax credit to give your workers paid time off to get vaccinated and recover if they need be.
And for anyone who still questions, that's okay—you still have questions. But act—act now. Act now. Talk to your family and friends who've gotten the—gotten vaccinated. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist. According to the American Medical Association, over 90 percent of physicians are fully vaccinated. They're making the choice to protect themselves and their communities and their patients. Follow their lead and make the choice for yourself.
As I said, we're heading into, God willing, the summer of joy, a summer of freedom. On July 4, we're going to celebrate our independence from the virus as we celebrate our independence of our Nation. We want everyone—everyone—to be able to do that.
Let's remember, we are the United States of America. Let's get this done, all of us, together.
God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you.
Q. Mr. President, do you have any comment on Catholic bishops?
Q. [Inaudible]
Q. Mr. President, do you have any comment on the Catholic bishops?
Delta Coronavirus Variant 
Q. Could the Delta variant force us back into lockdown?
The President. I don't think so, because so many people have already been vaccinated, but with—the Delta variant can cause more people to die in areas where people have not been vaccinated. Where people have gotten the two shots, the Delta variant is highly unlikely to result in anything, other than—I mean, as—the existing vaccines are very effective.
So no, it's not a lockdown, but some areas will be very hurt.
U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops 
Q. Sir, any comment about—[inaudible]—what the Catholic Bishops have done? Are you concerned about this rift within the Catholic Church? And are you concerned about this action?
The President. Say again?
Q. The Catholic Bishops are moving on this resolution that would prevent you and others who have supported abortion from receiving communion. Are you concerned about the rift in the Catholic Church? And how do you feel personally about that?
The President. That's a private matter, and I don't think that's going to happen. Thank you.
Q. Mr. President—[inaudible]——
Infrastructure and Jobs Legislation 
Q. Mr. President, have you seen the infrastructure plan on Capitol Hill, the bipartisan plan? Do you have any reaction to that?
The President. I'll tell you Monday when I get a copy of it.

Remarks on Signing the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act
","
The President. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Well, thank you, Madam Vice President.
One hundred and fifty-six years ago—156 years—June 19, 1865—John, thanks for being here—a major general of the Union Army arrived in Galveston, Texas, to enforce the Emancipation Proclamation and free the last enslaved Americans in Texas from bondage. A day, as you all know—I'm going to repeat some of what was said—that became known as Juneteenth. You all know that. A day that reflects what the Psalm tell us: ""Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.""
Juneteenth marks both the long, hard night of slavery and subjugation and a promise of a brighter morning to come. This is a day of profound—in my view—profound weight and profound power, a day in which we remember the moral stain, the terrible toll that slavery took on the country and continues to take, what I've long called ""America's original sin.""
At the same time, I also remember the extraordinary capacity to heal and to hope and to emerge from the most painful moments and a bitter, bitter version of ourselves, but to make a better version of ourselves.
And today we consecrate Juneteenth for what it ought to be, what it must be: a national holiday. As the Vice President noted, a holiday that will join the others of our national celebrations: our independence, our laborers who built this Nation, our service men and women who served and died in its defense. And the first new national holiday since the creation of Martin Luther King holiday nearly four decades ago.
I am grateful to the Members of Congress here today, in particular, the Congressional Black Caucus, who did so much to make this day possible. I'm especially pleased that we showed the Nation that we can come together as Democrats and Republicans to commemorate this day with the overwhelming bipartisan support of the Congress. I hope this is the beginning of a change in the way we deal with one another.
And we're blessed—we're blessed—to mark the day in the presence of Ms. Opal Lee. As my mother would say, ""God love her."" You know, I had the honor of meeting her in Nevada more than a year ago. She told me she loved me, and I believed it. [Laughter] I wanted to believe it. [Laughter] Ms. Opal, you're incredible. A daughter of Texas, grandmother of the movement to make Juneteenth a Federal holiday.
And Ms. Opal is—you won't believe it—she's 49 years old. [Laughter] Or 94 years old, but I—[laughter]. You are an incredible woman, Ms. Opal. You really are.
As a child growing up in Texas, she and her family would celebrate Juneteenth. On Juneteenth, 1939, when she was 12 years old, the White—a White mob torched her family home. But such hate never stopped her any more than it stopped the vast majority of you I'm looking at from this podium.
Over the course of decades, she's made it her mission to see that this day came. It was almost a singular mission. She's walked for miles and miles, literally and figuratively, to bring attention to Juneteenth, to make this day possible. I ask, once again, we all stand and give her a warm welcome to the White House.
As they still say in the Senate and I said for 36 years, ""if you excuse me there for a point of personal privilege,"" as I was walking down, I regret that my grandchildren aren't here because this is a really, really, really important moment in our history.
By making Juneteenth a Federal holiday, all Americans can feel the power of this day, and learn from our history, and celebrate progress, and grapple with the distance we've come, but the distance we have to travel, Jim.
You know, I said a few weeks ago, marking the hundredth anniversary of the Tulsa race massacre, great nations don't ignore their most painful moments. Great nations don't ignore their most painful moments. They don't ignore those moments of the past. They embrace them. Great nations don't walk away. We come to terms with the mistakes we made. And in remembering those moments, we begin to heal and grow stronger.
The truth is, it's not—simply not enough just to commemorate Juneteenth. After all, the emancipation of enslaved Black Americans didn't mark the end of America's work to deliver on the promise of equality, it only marked the beginning. To honor the true meaning of Juneteenth, we have to continue toward that promise because we've not gotten there yet. The Vice President and I and our entire administration and all of you in this room are committed to doing just that.
That's why we've launched an aggressive effort to combat racial discrimination in housing—finally address the cruel fact that a home owned, to this day, by a Black American family is usually appraised at a lower rate for a similar home owned by a White family in a similar area. That's why we committed to increasing Black homeownership, one of the biggest drivers of generational wealth.
That's why we're making it possible for more Black entrepreneurs to access capital—because their ideas are as good; they lack the capital to get their fair—and get their fair share of Federal contracts so they can begin to build wealth.
That's why we're working to give each and every child, 3 and 4 years of age, not daycare, but school—in a school. That's why we're unlocking the incredibly creative and innovation—innovation of the history—of our Historical Black Colleges and Universities, providing them with the resources to invest in research centers and laboratories to help HBCU graduates prepare and compete for good-paying jobs in the industries of the future.
Folks, the promise of equality is not going to be fulfilled until we become real—it becomes real in our schools and on our main streets and in our neighborhoods—our health care system and ensuring that equity is at the heart of our fight against the pandemic; in the water that comes out of our faucets and the air that we breathe in our communities; in our justice system—so that we can fulfill the promise of America for all people. All of our people.
And it's not going to be fulfilled so long as the sacred right to vote remains under attack. We see this assault from restrictive laws, threats of intimidation, voter purges, and more—an assault that offends the very democracy—our very democracy.
We can't rest until the promise of equality is fulfilled for every one of us in every corner of this Nation. That, to me, is the meaning of Juneteenth. That's what it's about. So let's make this Juneteenth—this very Juneteenth, tomorrow—the first that our Nation will celebrate all together, as one Nation—a Juneteenth of action on many fronts.
One of those is vaccinations. Tomorrow the Vice President will be in Atlanta on a bus tour, helping to spread the word, like all of you have been doing, on lifesaving vaccines. And across the country this weekend, including here in Washington, people will be canvassing and hosting events in their communities, going door to door, encouraging vaccinations.
We've built equity into the heart of the vaccination program from day one, but we still have more work to do to close the racial gap in vaccination rates. The more we can do that, the more we can save lives.
Today also marks the sixth anniversary of the tragic deaths of—at Mother Emanuel Church in Charleston, South Carolina. A killer motivated by hate, intending to start a race war in South Carolina, he joined his victims in a Bible study class; then, he took their lives in the house of worship. It's a reminder that our work to root out hate never ends, because hate only hides, it never fully goes away. It hides. And when you breathe oxygen under that rock, it comes out.
And that's why we must understand that Juneteenth represents not only the commemoration of the end of slavery in America more than 150 years ago, but the ongoing work to have to bring true equity and racial justice into American society, which we can do. In short, this day doesn't just celebrate the past; it calls for action today.
I wish all Americans a happy Juneteenth. I am shortly going to—in a moment, going to sign into law, making it a Federal holiday. And I have to say to you, I've only been President for several months, but I think this will go down, for me, as one of the greatest honors I will have had as President, not because I did it; you did it—Democrats and Republicans. But it's an enormous, enormous honor.
Thank you for what you've done. And by the way, typical of most of us in Congress and the Senate, I went down to the other end of the hall first and thanked your staffs because I know who does the hard work. [Laughter] No, they're down there. They're at the other end, but I thanked them as well.
May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you.
Now, I'd like to invite up, while I sign, Senator Tina Smith, Senator Ed Markey, Senator Raphael Warnock, Senator John Cornyn, Whip John [Jim]* Clyburn, Representative Barbara Lee, Representative Danny Davis, Chair Joyce Beatty, and Sheila Jackson Lee, and Ms. Opal.
[At this point, the President signed the bill.]

Remarks and an Exchange With Reporters in Geneva, Switzerland
","
The President. I owe my last questioner an apology. I shouldn't have been such a wise guy with the last answer I gave.
Anyway, thanks for being here. And most of you've been here the whole route. I really do think—not me, but I think we, the country, has put a different face on where we've been and where we're going. And I feel good about it. I feel—you know, one of things that I think, understandably, there was a good deal of skepticism about: would the G-7 sign on and give America back its, sort of, leadership role. I think it did. It wasn't me, but it meant they're glad America is back. They're glad America is back, and they acted that way.
And then, when we went to NATO, I think it was the same thing. We had really good meetings there and real response, as well as the EU. I didn't get one single person—not one of the world leaders—said to us anything other than thanking me for arranging a meeting with Putin. And I thought, quite frankly, I was in a much better position to represent the west, after the previous three meetings with Putin, that—knowing that the rest of the west was behind us. And so, I think—so I owe them all a debt of gratitude.
Infrastructure and Jobs Legislation 
Q. Mr. President, since you're now heading home, can I just ask you briefly about two domestic issues?
The President. I'm not sure I can answer them, but——
Q. If you could. First would be this fate of the infrastructure bill. There's now a bipartisan group that has a new offer. Have you had time to review it?
The President. I haven't seen it.
Q. Okay.
The President. No, I'm not being—I honestly haven't seen it. I don't know what the details are. I know that my Chief of Staff thinks there's some room that there may be a means by which to get this done. And I know that Schumer and Nancy have moved forward on a reconciliation provision as well. So I'm still hoping we could put together the two bookends here.
Q. The Iran nuclear deal——
Senate Minority Leader A. Mitchell McConnell 
Q. And the second issue is: Yesterday—or earlier this week, Mitch McConnell said that if Republicans were to take back the Senate in 2022, he did not see a way that you could get a Supreme Court Justice confirmed. Do you have a response to that?
The President. Uh——
Q. So this would be next year.
The President. No, I know. I know. The answer is: Mitch is—Mitch has been nothing but ""no"" for a long time. And I'm sure he means exactly what he says, but we'll see.
Iran/International Diplomatic Efforts 
Q. Mr. President, did you talk with President Putin about the Iran nuclear deal?
The President. Yes.
Q. Did you make—find a way? What did you discuss, and did you find a way to make some progress?
The President. It was about how we would jointly work, and I'm not going to discuss what we discussed.
The President's Approach to Diplomacy 
Q. Mr. President, Kaitlan's [Kaitlan Collins, CNN] question that you answered at the very end there, that you came over to talk about, I think at the heart of it was this question of whether or not you seem overly optimistic, given that—what we all listened to President Putin essentially say the same, old things that he's said forever. He—you know, rejecting all responsibility for all that stuff.
And I guess the question that she was trying to get, and maybe you could take another stab at it, is: What concrete evidence do you have from these 3 or 3-plus hours that suggest that any movement has been made?
And I don't know—I don't mean that to be—I'm not—it's not meant to be a——
The President. No, no, no. No. I know, but you're all——
Q. ——""gotcha"" question. I——
The President. Look, to be a good reporter, you've got to be negative. You've got to have a negative view of life—okay?—it seems to me, the way you all—you never ask a positive question.
Why, in fact, having agreement—we'll find out. We have an agreement to work on a major arms control agreement. I started on working on arms control agreements back all the way during the cold war. If we could do one when the cold war, why couldn't we do one now? We'll see. We will see whether or not it happens.
But what do you—I mean, the thing that always amazes me about the questions—and I apologize for having been short on this before. If you were in my position, would you say, ""Well, I don't think, man, anything is going to happen. This is going to be really rough. I think it's going to really be bad""? You guarantee nothing happens. You guarantee nothing happens.
And so, so far——
Q. So there's a value to——
The President. There's a value to being realistic and put on an optimistic front, an optimistic face.
Look, you all said the same thing about the, you know, what was going to happen when we had the first meeting of the Seven. ""Oh, Biden—they're not going to—they're not going to buy Biden's stuff. They're really not really""—any of you find that? Did that happen? Any of it? A little bit? Just a little sliver of it?
When I went to meet with NATO—""Oh, boy, they're not going to be happy. They're all going to be against Biden meeting with Putin. They're not going to want that."" Did you hear a single, solitary syllable?
Now, what would have happened if I had said, before I went into those negotiations: ""You know, I think it's going to be really hard. I think it's going to be really difficult. I'm not so optimistic about it. I don't see anybody really changing""?
And the same way when I met with the EU. ""The EU is not going to like the way Biden is operating.""
Q. But this is Vladimir Putin. I mean, can you be optimistic about his change?
The President. Sure, it's Vladimir Putin. But look, it was also—I don't want to compare him to Putin, but it was—the French President said he will never go for more money for NATO. Guess what? He's agreed.
Every—I mean, look, guys, I'm going to drive you all crazy—[laughter]—because I know you want me to always put a negative thrust on things, particularly in public, and negotiate in public.
I don't have to trust somebody—we didn't have to trust somebody to get START II. It wasn't about our trust—""Well, I trust the Russians. I can tell, man, they're really—they're—I can look in his eye, and they're really very, very truthful."" It's not that at all.
You have to figure out what the other guy's self-interest is. Their self-interest. I don't trust anybody—look, I've got to get in the plane, but I'll say it—you'll hear me say this more than once.
Q. It's your plane. You can go when you want. [Laughter]
The President. Yes, no, but—no, but here's the thing: Folks, I don't see any benefit ever to begin a negotiation as—and, I mean, you're the brightest people in the country. You're the most informed people on detail. I'm not being solicitous; you are. But it makes no sense for me to negotiate with you. It makes no sense for me to tell you what I'm about to do. It makes—not because I want to hide anything from you. Why would I telegraph that?
Russia/U.S. Leadership in Multilateral Affairs/Status of Democracy in the World 
Q. Did he do anything that surprised you, sir?
White House staffer. Sir, we need to go. Sir, we really have to go.
Q. Was there any moment that you were really surprised by?
White House staffer. Sir—thank you, guys. Thank you, guys.
The President. No, I wasn't surprised because I was convinced that—let me choose my words. Russia is in a very, very difficult spot right now. They are being squeezed by China. They want desperately to remain a major power. You all are writing about, not illegitimately, ""Biden already gave Putin what he wants: legitimacy, standing in the world stage with the President of the United States."" They desperately want to have—be relevant.
They have—and they don't want to be known as, as some critics have pointed and said, you know, the ""Upper Volta with nuclear weapons."" It matters. And I found it matters to almost every world leader—no matter where they're from—how they're perceived, their standing in the world. It matters to them. It matters to them in terms of their support at home as well.
And so I think that there is—I'm trying to think how to shorten this so I can get in the plane. [Laughter] I'm of the view that, in the last 3 to 5 years, the world has reached a fundamental inflection point about what it's going to look like 10 years from now. I mean it literally. It's not hyperbole. It's not like I'm trying to pump it up. I think it's a genuine reality.
And so each of the countries in—around the world, particularly those who had real power at one time or still do, are wondering: What—how do I maintain and sustain our leadership in the world? That's what the United States is going through right now. How do we sustain us being the leading, most powerful, and most democratic country in the world? A lot is going on.
I don't know about you, I never anticipated, notwithstanding no matter how persuasive President Trump was, that we'd have people attacking and breaking down the doors of the United States Capitol. I didn't think that would happen. I didn't think we'd—I'd see that in my lifetime. But it's reinforced what I've always known and what I got taught by my political science professors and by the senior members of the Senate that I admired when I got there: that every generation has to reestablish the basis of its fight for democracy. I mean, for real, literally have to do it.
And I've never seen, including during—since the Civil War, such an outward assault on voting rights. I mean, just a flat assault. I didn't anticipate that happening 4 years ago, but it's happening now.
So there's a lot at stake. Each of the countries, we have our own concerns and problems, but we still—as long as I'm President, we are going to stick to the notion that we're open, accountable, and transparent. And I think that's an important message to send the world.
Thank you all so much.
Q. Thank you, Mr. President.
Q. Come back and see us on the plane.

Remarks at the U.S.-European Union Summit Plenary Session in Brussels, Belgium
","
Well, thank you. Thank you both very much. It's been one of the great pleasures getting to know you both, you know, personally and just in terms of our official positions. And we were at the G-7, and again today—I apologize I kept my colleagues in the closed meeting.
But I want to—you know, this is—I haven't been back to Brussels and the EU since 2017, and since the—back then, also the first summit back in 2014. Anyway, but I brought the A-team with me today. And you know, I've said, both publicly and privately, that America is back, and this is why we're here in full force.
I'm happy to have with me today the members of my Cabinet: Secretary of State Antony Blinken—he suffers from the problem of having worked with me for years—and also Trade Representative, Ambassador Katherine Tai, who has made some real progress already; and Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, who was a first-rate Governor and one of the brightest people that we've worked with and agreed to come on as our Secretary of Commerce.
And one of the things that you and I were talking about— and will come as no shock to either of you: Europe is our natural partner, and the reason is, we're committed to the same democratic norms and institutions and are—and they are increasingly under attack.
And we—I've said before, and I apologize for repeating—oh, I didn't mention Jake Sullivan—[inaudible]—who is my National Security Adviser. I'm leaving out a lot of people here. I apologize. I'm going to get in trouble. But anyway, we'll get back to that in a minute.
But we—you know, there's a lot that is happening. I used to always—my friends would kid me in the United States Senate, because I served there, for always quoting Irish poets. You think I quoted Irish poets because I'm Irish. That's not the reason. I quote them because they're the best poets in the world; that's why. [Laughter]
But all kidding aside, there is a stanza from a poem from an Irish poet, who we just lost. He said: ""All is changed, changed utterly: A terrible beauty has been born."" I think all has changed in the last 10, 12 years, and it's not because of any one person.
I think we're in the midst of terrible beauty having been born—a great shift in technology, a great shift in the development of the world—and it's causing great anxiety in each our countries and uncertainty among many of our colleagues of what's going to be their place in the world. Are they going to be replaced by a new technology? Are they going to no longer have a job? And what are they going to do?
And that comes along at the same time that that also generates—when uncertainty is generated politically like that, by individuals, it also generates some folks who are less than—how can I say it?—some of them are like charlatans, trying to take advantage of those concerns. And we see it in Europe. We see it in the United States. We've seen it around the world. And it's phony populism.
So it seems to me that the best answer to deal with these changes is that—to have a circumstance where our economies grow and they grow together and they grow still based on the value set that united us in the first place. And I think we do share just the same basic values of human dignity and human rights as I've—my colleagues have.
I'll be very colloquial with you: My dad had a transition where, in the city we lived in, coal was dying; it was no longer relevant. You know, he was not a—my great-grandfather was a coal miner; he was a mining engineer. But when—in northeastern Pennsylvania, when coal died, my dad was a salesperson, and the economy collapsed. And we moved to another part where there were jobs, in southern—into—down in Delaware, a very—just across the Pennsylvania border.
And my family—my siblings and I would hear him often use the following expression. He said: ""Joe, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about your place in the community. It's about being able to look at your child in the eye and say 'Honey, it's going to be okay' and mean it."" I think we sometimes forget that. It's about the dignity of the worker and them being able to hold their head high.
And so I think we have an enormous opportunity, if we think in terms of these changes—particularly in terms of global warming—if we think of them in terms of jobs. The kind of jobs that we're going to have to create to preserve the environment are jobs that can pay well, that are going to be—use technologies that working class, blue-collar workers, as we say in the States, will be able to make more money, be able to do well. And—but we have to, all of us, accommodate those changes and provide for them.
And so I think we have a lot to deal with, from COVID-19 to whether or not we're in a position that we can generate the kind of strengthening transatlantic trade and technological cooperation. They're, sort of, a different set of priorities with the same objective: How do likeminded countries, sharing the same values, work together to improve the living standard for not only our people, but for the rest of the world? And I think we have the capacity to do that, and it's going to take an awful lot of hard work and determination.
And I'll conclude by saying: One of the reasons I'm optimistic is because of our younger generation, in Europe as well as the United States. The young generation—this one—is the best educated in American history. It is also the least prejudiced, the most open, and the most committed.
And I think that we have reason to believe that if we provide the policies that are consistent, that provide for the kind of growth and opportunity for them—and education plays a gigantic part of that—I think we—I think the future is very, very bright. I think we have an opportunity to do some, really, very good things.
And with that, I should—as my mother would say, I should ""hush up"" and let this discussion move forward.

President Michel. Well, Mr. President, dear Joe, we are so pleased to welcome you in Brussels. You are back in Brussels, and America is back on the global scene. It's great news. It's great news for our alliance. It's also great news for the world. And we are really delighted to work with you in order to tackle, together, some important global challenges.
President Biden. Well, I think we have a great opportunity to work both with the EU, as well as NATO. And we're feeling very good about it. We found the reception to be good, and I—and America is back.
We are committed. We have never fully left, but we are reasserting the fact that it's overwhelmingly in the interest of the United States of America to have a great relationship with NATO and with the EU. I have a very different view than my predecessor did.
So I'm looking forward to talking with you all about what we're about to do.
President von der Leyen. Yes.
President Biden. And I'm anxious to begin.
President von der Leyen. And a very warm welcome for my part too. What a pleasure to have you here. What an honor to have you here.
So the fact that you are coming so early in your mandate, I think, underlines your personal attachment to Europe, and we really appreciate that.
And indeed, the last 4 years have not been easy. The world has dramatically changed. Europe has changed. But we wanted to reassure you: We are friends and allies, and we are very much looking forward to working together. So a very warm welcome.
President Biden. Well, we have great opportunities to take advantage of each other. Thank you.
