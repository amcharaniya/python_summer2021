Remarks on Fighting the COVID-19 Pandemic and an Exchange with Reporters
","
THE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon. Last week, I laid out what we need to do to beat the COVID-19 vi- -- pandemic and the challenges posed by the Delta variant.
This is a very different variant than what we've dealt with previously. It's highly transmissible, and it's causing a new wave of cases. It accounts for over 80 percent of all COVID-19 cases in the United States today. Experts tell us that we're going to see these cases rise in the weeks ahead -- a largely preventable tragedy that will get worse before it gets better.
What's different about this surge from previous ones is we have the tools to prevent this rise in cases from shutting down
our businesses, our schools, our society, as we saw what happened last year.
And while cases are on the rise, it's important to note we've not seen a comparable rise in hospitalizations or deaths in most areas of the country.
That's because 165 million Americans are fully vaccinated, including 80 percent of the most vulnerable Americans -- our seniors.
The best line of defense against the Delta vac- -- the virus is the vaccine. It's as simple as that. Period. The vaccine.
I want to be crystal clear about what's happening in the country today: We have a pandemic of the unvaccinated.
Now, I know there's a lot of misinformation out there, so here are the facts: If you're vaccinated, you are highly unlikely to get COVID-19. And even if you do, the chances are you won't show any symptoms; and if you do, they'll most likely be very mild.
Vaccinated people almost never are hospitalized with COVID-19. In fact, according to one recent study, 95 percent of overall COVID-19 hospitalizations are among those not fully vaccinated.
And the data shows that virtually all the cases, hospitalizations, and deaths due to COVID-19 are from the unvaccinated population.
Last month, a study showed that over 99 percent of COVID-19 deaths have among -- have been among the unvaccinated people. Ninety-nine percent.
That means, if you're unvaccinated, you are much more likely to, one, get COVID-19; two, get hospitalized; and, three, die if you get it.
This is a tragedy. People are dying and will die who don't have to die. The data is absolutely clear: As I've said, we have a pandemic of the unvaccinated.
Think of it this way: A hundred and ninety-one million Americans have gotten at least one shot, including 70 percent of adults over the age of 18. A hundred and sixty-five million Americans are fully vaccinated, but about ninety million Americans are eligible for vaccines and still haven't gotten their first shot.
You know, I think there's a clear link between the lowest-vaccinated -- I know -- I don't think, actually -- the lowest-vaccinated states and the states with the highest case rates.
This past week, the most vaccinated state in America,
Vermont, has seen just five new cases -- five -- per day of COVID-19 for every 100,000 people who live in that state. That means, on any given day, only 30 people in the entire state of Vermont got COVID-19.
Nearby Maine, which has vaccinated almost 80 percent of their adults, has seen just six new cases per 100,000.
But the states with the lowest vaccination rates are seeing 10 to 20 times as many new cases per 100,000 people. It's moving like wildfire through the unvaccinated community. And it's heartbreaking, particularly because it's preventable.
That's why we're doing everything we can to get more people vaccinated. And we're seeing real results.
In the past two weeks, we have seen a 55 percent increase in the average number of new people getting vaccinated every day.
In the last seven days alone, nearly 3 million Americans have gotten their first shot. That's the highest seven-day total in a month.
Importantly, over the past two weeks, the eight states with the highest current case rates have seen a doubling of the number of people newly vaccinated each day. The message is getting through, apparently.
Louisiana has seen a 212 percent increase in the average number of newly vaccinated people in that state per day, going from 3,600 to over 11,000 people vaccinated per day.
Arkansas is up 99 percent. Mississippi is up 125 percent. Alabama is up 186 percent -- going from 3,200 to 9,150 people vaccinated per day. This will make a big difference.
These are encouraging signs. We have to continue our aggressive efforts to vaccinate the unvaccinated.
Last week, I announced additional steps to incentivize Americans to get vaccinated, including calling on states to offer $100 for anyone willing to step up and get a vaccination shot.
You know, and already Minnesota and New Mexico have done that. And North Carolina announced its 100-day incentive -- its $100 incentive today.
Places that have offered the hundred thou- -- the hundred thousand -- (laughs) -- the hundred dollars -- that'd be really good. I'd go back and get vaccinated three times. (Laughter.) But all kidding aside, offered the $100 to get vaccination have seen an uptick of 25 percent of daily vaccination rates.
We also announced that small- and medium-sized businesses will be fully reimbursed for offering paid time off for their employees to get vaccinated and for them to take a child or a parent to get vaccinated.
And I announced some tough, sometimes unpopular steps to keep people safe and our economy strong. All federal workers must report their vaccination status or be subject to strict requirements. Any federal worker who does not attest to their vaccination status or is not vaccinated will be required to mask no matter where they work, test one to twice a week, socially distance, and generally will not be allowed to travel for work.
I directed my administration to take steps to apply similar standards to all federal contractors. If you want to do business with the federal government, get your workers vaccinated.
And I also directed the Pentagon to look at adding COVID-19 to the list of vaccinations that are required for our troops because others are required.
I approved the Department of Veterans Affairs to require doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers who care for our veterans to be vaccinated.
And the good news is that now many are following the federal government's lead. In the past several days, states and local officials have come out to impose similar vaccination mandates.
And the private sector is stepping up as well. Even Fox has vaccination requirements. I want to thank Walmart, Google, Netflix, Disney, Tyson Foods for their recent actions requiring vaccination for employees.
Look, I know this isn't easy, but I will have their backs and the backs of other private and public sector leaders if they take such steps.
But others have declined to step up. I find it disappointing. And worst of all, some state officials are passing laws or signing orders that forbid people from doing the right thing.
As of now, seven states not only ban mask mandates, but also ban them in their school districts, even for young children who cannot get vaccinated. Some states have even banned businesses and universities from requiring workers and students to be masked or vaccinated.
And the most extreme of those measures is like the one in Texas that say state universities or community colleges could be fined if it allows a teacher to ask her unvaccinated students to wear a mask.
What are we doing?
COVID-19 is a national challenge, and we must come together -- we have to come together -- all of us together, as a country, to solve it.
Make no mistake: The les- -- the exc- -- ex- -- excuse me -- the escalation of cases is particularly concentrated in states with low vaccination rates. Just two states, Florida and Texas, account for one third of all new COVID-19 cases in the entire country. Just two states.
Look, we need leadership from everyone. And if some governors aren't willing to do the right thing to beat this pandemic, then they should allow businesses and universities who want to do the right thing to be able to do it.
I say to these governors, ""Please, help."" But if you aren't going to help, at least get out of the way of the people who are trying to do the right thing. Use your power to save lives.
I've made it our first and top priority to have a vaccine available for every single American from the day I got elected. That was my priority. And let me be clear: We have a supply for every single American, and that will never change.
At the same time, it's also in our national interest to share some of our vaccines with the world, which gets me to the second thing I want to discuss today.
From the beginning of my presidency, I've been very clear-eyed that we need to attack this virus globally, not just at home, because it's in America's self-interest to do so.
The virus knows no boundaries. You can't build a wall high enough to keep it out. There is no wall high enough or ocean wide enough to keep us safe from a vaccination in other -- from the COVID-19 in other countries.
In fact, just like the original virus that caused COVID-19, the Delta variant came from abroad. As long as the virus continue to rage outs- -- rage outside the United States, potentially more dangerous variants could arrive at our shores again.
And we know that COVID-19 in other countries stifles economic growth, disrupts supply chains, risks instability and weakness of governments. And as we've seen in the United States, the key to growing economies is to vaccinate people.
So just as the American economy is recovering, it's in all of our interests to have global -- the global economy begin to recover as well.
This is about our values. We value inherent dignity of all people -- the inherent dignity of everyone. In times of trouble, Americans reach out to offer a helping hand. That's who we are.
And I've said before: In this fight against COVID-19, the United States is committed to be the arsenal of vaccines, just as we were the arsenal of democracy during World War Two.
And we're backing up that commitment. We have contributed more than any other nation to COVAX -- the collective global efforts delivering COVID-19 vaccines across the world.
We have supported manufacturing efforts abroad through our partnerships with Japan, India, Australia –- known as ""the Quad.""
During my trip to Europe in June, I announced that the United States would purchase a groundbreaking 500 million doses of Pfizer and then donate them -- those doses -- nearly -- to nearly a hundred low- and middle-income countries who don't have the vaccine. Those doses will start to ship at the end of this month.
We also announced that we'd donate 80 million doses of our own vaccine to supply the world, which has already begun.
And today, I have an important update. We've already exceeded 80 million doses that have been -- gone out. As of today, the United States has shipped over 110 million doses of U.S. vaccines to 65 countries that are among the hardest hit in the world.
Let me say it again: As of today, we have shipped over 110 million doses to 65 nations.
According to the United Nations, this is more than the donations of all 24 countries that have donated any vaccine to other countries, including China and Russia -- all those nations combined.
These vaccine donations from America are free. We're not selling them. There are no demands, no conditions, no coercion attached. And there is no favoritism and no strings attached. We're doing this to save lives and to end this pandemic. That's it.
In fact, we're donating vaccines to countries that have real issues -- we have real issues with.
And we'll continue to give tens of millions of the doses away across the summer and work to increase U.S. manufacturing and manufacturing of vaccines around the world as well.
And it's not just vaccines. We are continuing to provide
countries with -- in need -- with more testing, protective equipment, and personnel to stem the surge of the virus. We've done it in India and elsewhere.
Let me close with this. I've said before: In the race for the 21st century between democracies and autocracies, we need to prove that democracies can deliver.
And the democracies of the world are looking to America to lead again -- in two ways. First, to demonstrate we can control this virus at home. And second, to show we can help address it around the world.
Vaccinate America and help vaccinate the world -- that's how we're about to beat this thing.
We're always going to have enough doses for every American who wants one. Our work in donating vaccines to the world is about America following through on our promises and delivering what we say we'll deliver.
It's showing how American science and technology, American businesses and academia, and our government can all work together.
Above all, it's proving democracies can deliver and, yet again, that America is back leading the world -- not by the example of our power, but by the power of our example.
We still have a lot of work to do. So if you're unvaccinated, please, please, please get the shot.
But just don't take it from me. Just read the news. Listen to the voices of the unvaccinated patients in the hospital. They are spending [sending] the most powerful message to their families and everyone around the world -- a powerful message to everybody. As they're lying in bed, many dying from COVID-19, they're asking, ""Doc, can I get the vaccine?"" The doctors have to look them in the eye and say, ""No, sorry. It's too late.""
Right now, too many people are dying or watching a loved one dying and saying, ""If I just got vaccinated. If I just…""
Folks, this is isn't about politics. The virus doesn't care if you're a Democrat or a Republican. This is about life and death. Life and death.
I can't say it any more plainly than this: The vaccine saves lives, and it could save yours or your child's.
You know, I know we can do this. We're the United States of America. We're prepared like never before. We have the tools and the resources to save lives at home and around the world.
This is who we are. This is what we do. This is why there's no nation like us on Earth.
God bless you all. And may God protect our troops.
And I'll take a few questions.
Q: Mr. President, I have a question for you on coronavirus, but first I'd like to start with the news of the day -- given, back in March, you said that if the investigation confirmed the allegations against Governor Cuomo, then he should resign. So, will you now call on him to resign, given the investigators said the 11 women were credible?
THE PRESIDENT: I stand by that statement.
Q: Are you now calling on him to resign?
THE PRESIDENT: Yes.
Q: And if he doesn't resign, do you believe he should be impeached and removed from office?
THE PRESIDENT: Let's take one thing at a time here. I think he should resign.
Q: Do you think --
THE PRESIDENT: I understand that the state legislature may decide to impeach. I don't know that for a fact; I've not read all that data.
Q: And he's using a photo of you embracing him in his self-defense to say that these are commonplace kind of embraces that he made in the allegations against him. Do you condone that?
THE PRESIDENT: Look, I'm not going to flyspeck this. I'm sure there are some embraces that were totally innocent, but app- -- apparently, the Attorney General decided there were things that weren't.
Q: And on coronavirus, if I could ask you a question about the evictions.
THE PRESIDENT: Why don't you come up and take the platform? (Laughter.)
Q: No, thank you.
On the evictions and the moratorium that lapsed on Saturday night: What is your strategy to prevent potentially millions of people from being evicted from their homes, given what we are told your administration is considering -- a targeted moratorium -- is likely to face legal challenges?
THE PRESIDENT: Any call for a moratorium based on the Supreme Court recent decision is likely to face obstacles. I've indicated to the CDC I'd like them to look at other alternatives than the one that is in pow- -- in existence, which the Court has declared they're not going to allow to continue. And the CDC will have something to announce to you in the next hour to two hours.
Q: Thank you.
Q: President Biden, on overseas coronavirus vaccines: Should other high-income countries follow the lead of the United States and increase donations to low- and middle-income countries?
THE PRESIDENT: I think those countries that have been able to cover their population and have the ability to provide either dollars and/or vaccine for the 100 or so na- -- poor nations that need help should do so. We had that discussion at the G7. A number of those countries said they were going to do that. Some have followed through.
The point I was making is, though, I've kept the commitment -- we've kept the commitment that we would do what we said, which is more than all the rest of the countries combined thus far.
Q: Mr. President, do you believe that Governor DeSantis and Governor Abbott are personally making decisions that are harming their own citizens?
THE PRESIDENT: I believe the results of their decisions are not good for their constituents. And it's clear to me and to most of the medical experts that the decisions being made, like not allowing mask mandates in school and the like, are bad health policy -- bad health policy.
Q: Mr. President, I have a question about something that you just said.
THE PRESIDENT: I'm sure you do.
Q: Thank you. You just said there is no wall high enough and no ocean wide enough to protect us from the virus. So what is the thinking behind letting untested and unvaccinated migrants cross the southern border into U.S. cities in record numbers?
THE PRESIDENT: There is -- what we're doing -- we have not withdrawn the order that is sometimes critical -- criticized -- saying that unvaccinated people should be -- go back across the border.
But unaccompanied children is a different story, because there's -- that's the most humane thing to do is to test them and to treat them and not send them back alone.
Q: Mr. President, have you spoken with Governor Cuomo today?
THE PRESIDENT: I have not.
Q: And then one other question on the virus. You just said we have -- we have to continue our aggressive efforts to get the unvaccinated vaccinated. Other countries have found a lot of success in requiring vaccines in public places. New York City just announced today that they'll require vaccines for restaurants and gyms. Do you think more cities and states should institute rules like that?
THE PRESIDENT: I do.
Q: And are you going to publicly call on them? Should they institute a vaccine passport-type system, or it's up to each city and state to figure that out on their own?
THE PRESIDENT: I'm sorry. What did you say?
Q: Do you think that they should institute a vaccine passport-type system or some sort of verification to use public spaces?
THE PRESIDENT: I don't think they need to do that. I think they just need to give the authority of those restaurants or businesses to say, ""In order to come in, you have to give proof that you've been vaccinated or you can't come in.""
I'll take a couple more.
Q: Mr. President can I ask you about news of the day -- one more on Governor Cuomo? You're calling for him to resign now. My question is: Do you think he should be prosecuted? And what is your message to the women who have now accused him of sexually harassing them and abusing them?
THE PRESIDENT: Look, what I said was: If the investigation of the Attorney General concluded that the allegations were correct, that -- back in March -- that I would recommend he resign. That's what I'm doing today. I've not read the report. I don't know the detail of it. All I know is the end result.
Q: Mr. President, a question on COVID, if I could, really quickly. It's the eviction moratorium. Can you explain a little bit more why it took so long to have a possible eviction moratorium be put into place? There was -- there are people -- this expired on Saturday. I'm wondering -- there are folks who are saying it took too long for this to happen.
THE PRESIDENT: Well, look, the courts made it clear that the existing moratorium was not constitutional; it wouldn't stand. And they made that clear back in, I guess, July 15th or July 18th.
In the meantime, what I've been pushing for and calling for is we have billions of dollars that were given to states to provide for rent and utilities for those people who can't afford to stay in their homes because they can't -- an apartment -- they can't pay their rent. And so, we're urging them to distribute those funds to the landlords. I believe that would take care of the vast majority of what needs to be done to keep people in their -- in their ho- -- in their apartments now.
And so that's what we're working on. Some states have done it and some communities have, but they have not. The money is there. It's not -- we don't have to send it out. It's been sent out to the states and counties -- billions of dollars -- for the express purpose of providing for back rent and rent for the people who are in the middle of this crisis. And that's there; that's what we're pushing now. And we've been pushing that. That's the immediate thing to do.
I'll take one more question.
Q: Mr. President, thank you so much. There was an expectation that you would be announcing new vaccines to the world today -- a new -- other than the ones you promised. Are you ready to send more vaccines to the world?
And there is a delegation from the White House going to Brazil tomorrow. Are they bringing more vaccines? Are they announcing more vaccines to Brazil?
THE PRESIDENT: No -- are they announcing more vaccines overall?
Q: Overall. And then to Brazil -- for the delegation coming to Brazil tomorrow -- will you be bringing vaccines?
THE PRESIDENT: The answer is: I don't know whether the delegation going physically has vaccines with them. We have provided vaccines to --
Q: Are they bringing the announcement? Are they announcing there?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, no, there's a need for several billion doses around the world. We have committed to over a half a billion doses. And we're trying to provide for more and provide for the capacity of countries like India to be able to produce the vaccine themselves. And we're helping them do that. That's what we're doing now.
And we're trying to -- we're -- and, by the way, it's free. We're not charging anybody anything. And we're trying to do as much as we possibly can.
Thank you all very much.
Q: Mr. President, we're learning that your administration is about to announce a new partial eviction moratorium, COVID related. Can you tell us any more about that? And are you sure it's going to pass Supreme Court muster?
THE PRESIDENT: The answer is twofold. One, I've sought out constitutional scholars to determine what is the best possibility that would come from executive action, or the CDC's judgment, what could they do that was most likely to pass muster, constitutionally.
The bulk of the constitutional scholarship says that it's not likely to pass constitutional muster. Number one. But there are several key scholars who think that it may and it's worth the effort. But the present -- you could not -- the Court has already ruled on the present eviction moratorium.
So I think what you're going to see, and I -- look, I want to make it clear: I told you I would not tell the Justice Department or the medical experts, the scientists what they should say or do. So I don't want to get ahead.
The CDC has to make the -- I asked the CDC to go back and consider other options that may be available to them. You're going to hear from them what those other options are.
I have been informed they're about to make a judgment as to potential other options. Whether that option will pass constitutional measure with this administration, I can't tell you. I don't know. There are a few scholars who say it will and others who say it's not likely to.
But, at a minimum, by the time it gets litigated, it will probably give some additional time while we're getting that $45 billion out to people who are, in fact, behind in the rent and don't have the money. That's why it was passed in -- in the act that we passed in the beginning of my administration, and it went to the states.
We were under the impression that the states were moving this money out relatively rapidly. So, for example, if I'm in an apartment -- if you're in an apartment, and you're behind on four- or five-month's rent, and let's say your rent is $2,000 a month -- I'm just making this up out of the blue -- and you're behind, you need $10,000 to catch up. Hardly anybody has that $10,000. But there is money that the states have that can give to the landlord that $10,000 to the back rent.
The future rent, it's unlikely -- at least the hope is, since they have been made whole to that point -- that they'd be inclined -- because the economy is growing -- inclined not to throw someone out in the street; keep that person -- no guarantee -- keep that person in the apartment, keep these kids in the same school district, and count on being able to have the opportunity for that -- that person to be able -- who may now be employed -- to pay their rent.
But in the meantime, I've asked, isn't there any safety valve we can put in? And it's the one I explained to you. Again, CDC will announce that and the details of exactly how it works. I'm not telling -- I told them I want them to take a look. I didn't tell them what they had to do.
And my hope is, it's going to be a new moratorium that in some way -- and I'm not going to announce it now; I'll let them announce it -- in some way covers close to 90 percent of the American people who are renters. And so that's all I can tell you now.
Thank you very much.
Q: Why not 100 percent? What's the difference?
THE PRESIDENT: Because it's a -- (laughs) -- let them explain that to you. Okay? I don't want to get too far ahead.
Thank you.
Q: Mr. President, is COVAX doing enough to get shots in arms?
Q: Why not call Governor DeSantis, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.) To say ""happy birthday""? What? I mean --
Q: To deliver the message that you seem to be delivering today about ""get out of the way.""
THE PRESIDENT: He knows the message. He knows the message. We had a little discussion when I was down there. He knows the message.
Q: What did he say to you in that discussion?
THE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.) See you all later.

Remarks in a Meeting with Latino Community Leaders and an Exchange with Reporters
","
THE PRESIDENT: Okay. Well, everybody, welcome. Today, I have the privilege of meeting with Latino leaders to discuss a bunch of key issues that affect the community; the progress we're making against the pandemic; historic and economic recovery we're under- -- that's undergoing -- we're undergoing; and immigration and voting rights, which are critical.
Latino leaders have been essential to helping us get the country vaccinated, with 70 percent of all adult Americans receiving at least one shot.
The vaccines work. Even as cases go up due to the highly transmissionable [sic] -- transmissible disease, the Delta variant, we're not seeing a comparable rise in hospitalizations or deaths in most of the country because of the vaccinations. This is an epidemic of the unvaccinated -- a pandemic of the unvaccinated.
But we need everyone to get vaccinated in this pandemic. And it's critical to keeping the economy strong.
And in six months, we're seeing the fastest job growth of any point in any administration in history from the beginning of their administration, and the fastest economic growth in nearly 40 years.
And we have an opportunity to make historic investments in infrastructure and in American families, and finally build an economy that deals everybody in.
I've been saying from the beginning when I announced that I'm tired of trickle down. It doesn't work very well. But when you build from the bottom up and the middle out, everybody does well, including the wealthy. That's what this is all about.
And so, creating millions of good-paying jobs in every community and -- including Latino neighborhoods -- delivering affordable child and -- care and paid leave and universal pre-K, two years of community college.
You know, today marks, as we all know -- no one knows this better than this community – a two-year -- two years of -- since the shooting in El Paso. And all of us have, in our personal lives, lost people unexpectedly. Most of us have. We know how devastating it is, particularly one that was born out of such hatred.
But you know, I did a piece -- Jill and I did a piece for the El Paso Times, but I realized after it was published that I didn't talk about an aspect that is really important: There were 236 people who were wounded. How are they doing? The trauma. The equivalent of post-traumatic stress that comes from these kinds of things. I -- and the need for -- and I hope we'll -- we can talk about it a little bit later as well -- is the need for mental health services and a whole range of things that affect not only them but their families when they've survived.
But to the families who have lost loved ones, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart, Jill and send our love -- as all of you do, I know.
But I know, you know, these anniversaries are -- should be celebrated in a sense of recognize -- so we see things don't happen again. But, you know, they're terrible for the victims and the survivors because it brings back everything like it happened the very moment ago. And I -- it takes enormous courage for people to -- to respond that way.
You know, and I know how hard these anniversaries are. As I said, no matter how much time has passed, it brings it all back like it happened that second.
The El Paso community -- you know, they continue to show their courage and the resilience. But to all Americans, this tragedy reminds us of the unfinished work to heal -- and I know I got criticized for running on it, but I really mean it -- heal the soul of this country. We have to return to some decency and honor, and I just -- anyway.
The gunman targeted people and the diversity of El Paso and our most deeply held American values. And, you know, we all act together to counter what is basically domestic terrorism, domestic violence, domestic extremism, and end the scourge of gun violence in America. We can't end it, but we sure can make a big difference than what it is now. And so, I continue to do everything in my power to do that.
The most lethal terrorist threat to our homeland in recent years is domestic terrorism -- domestic terrorism rooted in white supremacy. We're going to have to stand united against this violence because it just spills over to all communities.
And my administration is carrying out the country's first-ever comprehensive effort to tackle the threat of domestic terrorism -- from reducing online radicalization to disrupting networks that inspire violence, and providing resources to communities to build up some resilience.
And I'm going to continue to fight this for more commonsense gun laws. And we're going to continue to call on Congress to take action, which they've been reluctant to do.
That includes a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines like the one used in El Paso. The idea anybody needs, for a pistol and/or a rifle -- anyone needs 10, 12, 20, 30, 100 rounds in a rifle is just -- it just makes no sense at all. Zero. Doesn't violate anybody's Second Amendment rights to say, ""You can't do that."" But it just has to stop.
And that includes using my existing authority, which I have, to -- from reining in ""ghost guns"" and -- to investing in community policing and community violence intervention, to having -- bringing in psychologists and social workers into the police forces to help.
And, you know, I look forward to hearing from this group about all of these issues and a lot more. And -- but, with that, we're going to discuss a wide range of issues, all of us here tonight -- today. And I'm looking forward to it.
So, thank you all. Thank you, press, for being here.
Q: Mr. President, should Andrew Cuomo resign, sir? Should Andrew Cuomo resign?
THE PRESIDENT: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Q: Should Andrew Cuomo resign, sir?

I'm going to be speaking on COVID at four o'clock this afternoon, and I'll take questions on COVID and other issues after that.
Thank you.

Remarks at a Virtual Fundraising Reception for the Democratic National Committee
","
Via Teleconference
7:19 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Tom. Thanks for that introduction and for your generous support. And I want to thank you all. And, Jamie, for your support as well and being willing to take on the chairmanship.
You know, I didn't have it like you did, but I remember when my dad -- when things died up in Scranton; the coal dried up. He wasn't a coalminer; my great grandfather was. But he wasn't a coalminer, but everything else dried up. And he said -- I remember him going home to my grandpop, who had four sons and a daughter, and asking him is it okay if his wife -- my mother, Jean -- and the three kids move in with him for a year or so until they got straightened away down in northern Delaware -- a little town called Claymont.
And so that -- and he said -- I'll never forget it. He said, ""I'll come home every weekend, Joey. Every weekend. There's only 147 -- 157 miles."" And I thought, ""My God, that's a million miles."" I was going -- I was in third grade, going into fourth. And you know, it's a --
They used to have an expression -- and that's never -- and this is the God's truth. We got down to Delaware, as he worked his way through, after five years, being able to buy a small three-bedroom home. He used to say, ""Joey, a job is a lot more than a paycheck. It's about -- it's about your pride. It's about your place in the community. It's about your ability to look your kids in the eye. It's about your dignity."" And so it's much -- so much more.
And so, you know, when I ran with your help -- and I couldn't have made it -- with all the help of people on this line -- you know -- you know, we are part of something special because you allowed me to compete.
We -- I think we put together one of the most consequential campaigns in modern history. Because it really was, in my view, a battle for the soul of the nation: basic decency, building the middle class form the bottom up and the middle out, rather than waiting for everything to trickle down.
And a lot of you are very successful people on the line, but you shared that view and you gave me the money and contributions to be able to complete -- you know, I say -- I should say ""compete.""
And so, we're bound together in one of the most consequential first six months in the history of this country not because of me -- it's about the country; it's about people stepping up.
Think about the last six months. The American Rescue Plan.
We delivered shots in arms of millions and millions of people. Checks in pockets to hundreds of millions of Americans. And maybe the thing that I'm proudest of: We got the biggest middle-class tax cut of all time with the help of the -- cutting the child poverty in half through the childcare -- the Child Tax Credit.
And 165 million Americans are fully vaccinated. You got over 190 that have at least one shot -- one shot.
It's the fastest job growth in the first four months of any previous presidency. Period.
And a projected economic growth at nearly 7 percent -- the highest in four decades.
And last week, they -- the infrastructure plan that I introduced when I was running and put together with a bipartisan group -- I had to make some compromises, but it's going to make a gigantic difference.
For example, it's going to transform the economy. It's over -- over a trillion dollars. It's going to eliminate all lead pipes in America so people have decent drinking water. Build roads up to -- up to snuff so we build them back to, you know, making sure that they are where the environment is now -- not -- we have to build them back better. Childcare. The caring economy. The eldercare. The things that the American public wants most.
Man, look -- and delivering high-speed Internet to every American. Delivering clean water, as I said, to every American.
Building more resilient power grids. Installing electric vehicle charging stations-- over 500,000. The largest investment in public transit in rail since the creation of Amtrak 50 years ago.
But it's all about, as my dad's notion, it's about creating good-paying American jobs for millions of middle-class people and the working-class people. And it's about our economic competitiveness.
You know, as a -- as the Democratic Party, I think we're going to be able to say, going into these off-year elections, as the chairman said, that we can deliver. We can deliver for the American people. We can bring the country together. We can make a difference in their lives.
And, you know, it's about including everyone this time around -- Black, Latino, Asian American, Native American communities -- because I said the administration and our efforts would reflect what the country looked like.
And as I said, we're in the race for the 21st century economy and the rest of the world is not hanging around and waiting. We have to move fast.
And the bottom line, for me, is this: that we're signaling -- we're signaling to the rest of the world and to ourselves that we can function, we can deliver, we can do significant things. And we've got a lot more to do as we invest in physical infrastructure, also invest in human infrastructure, childcare, paid leave, universal pre-K through two years of -- and two years of community college.
When I hear about, ""Well, you know, that's not -- that's not investing"" -- well, let me tell you, when I was Vice President, I was asked to do a survey along the Secretary of Commerce of the 500 CEOs of the five -- Fortune 500 to see what their greatest needs are. We got the 340-some. You know what they said, almost to a person? They said, ""We need a better-educated public."" Well, they're not educating the public. And so, what are we going to do?
If I said to you tomorrow, ""We can maintain exorbitant tax cuts for the super wealthy"" -- and many of you are -- ""or we can make sure that every kid, starting at age three, four, and five, is in preschool, not daycare, and they have access to community college so we're the best-educated public in the world,"" which do you think is going to best promote the country's growth? You know what it is.
So, look, let me close. I'm -- I'm taking too much time. I want to meet each one of you. But, look, we need -- the single-most important thing that we have to do is we have to protect the voting system, protect the sacred right to vote. It's under assault in ways I haven't seen in my entire career. And I was the guy who was able to get the Voting Rights exten- -- Act extended 25 years before, when I was Chairman of the Judiciary Committee. And it wasn't until the Supreme Court came along and said, ""No, no, don't need it anymore.""
It's about who gets to vote and whether the vote counts, and who gets to count that vote. We have a system that does both those things with independence and integrity. But what Republicans want to do is say a political party gets to decide if a vote counts. It's outrageous. We're going to fight like hell so that doesn't happen. That's one of the most important things we can do.
There's a lot of work ahead. It's not going to be easy. But I'm going to need you to do it. The DNC is going to need you. And because -- here's the deal: We won in 2020 as a unified party. As we look to 2022, we need to stay unified. The question the American people are going to be asking is whether we're helping them and their families, and do we understand what they're going through; do we understand their problem; can we deliver for them.
You know, as Democrats, we have to show that we understand, number one; we're delivering, number two; and we're keeping our promise. We just have to keep making our case -- just as the Republican party today offers nothing but fear, lies, and broken promises. We have to keep cutting through the Republican fog --that the government isn't the problem, and show that we, the people -- we, the people, are always the solution.
We're the most unique country in the history of the world. You've heard me say this before. We're the only country that's organized based on an ide- -- on an idea, not religion, ethnicity, geography -- on an idea that we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men and women are critical equal, endowed -- you know the rest.
But you have to be able to vote. It's the single-most important thing we could do. And we're going to have to win races up and down the ticket.
You know, in 2018, I was out of office, but I campaigned in 58 districts -- congressional districts they said we couldn't win. We won back the United States Congress.
And, look, if we make the right decision in the next few years, in 50 years people are going to look back and say, ""This was the moment that America won the 21st century."" I really believe that. But we can't do it without you. You know, we have to prove that democracies can work.
I'll conclude by saying -- and the press on the line has heard me say this before -- that Xi Jinping, and -- who I met hours and hours with -- over 25 hours -- 24 hours alone. When I won, he called me to congratulate me. We spent two hours and, I think, almost 25 minutes on the phone.
He believes, along with other autocrats, that in the modern world, things are changing so rapidly, so quickly that democracies can't get their acts together and unite to compete with -- with autocratic governments. He truly believes that. And he's decided that they're going to be the most powerful military force in the world, and the largest economy and the most organized economy in the world by 2045.
We've got to demonstrate that democracies can work and protect. And I think it's going to impact on our influence around the world more than anything.
That's why we have to do some of this stuff together with others to get it done -- get it done. And I'm convinced there's not much we can't do. I think the country is ready. And because of you, I think we're going to be able to get it done.
But I want to thank you all. Thank you for everything you've done. And, you know, we got to prove we can make democracy work again. That's what it's about.
So, God bless you all for what you've done and going -- going to do. And may God protect our troops.

Remarks in a Meeting with Cuban American Leaders and an Exchange with Reporters
","
THE PRESIDENT: Well, I'm honored to welcome members of the Cuban American community, and Senator Menendez, Senator [Congressman] Meeks to discuss how the United States is going to continue to stand with the Cuban people, who have suffered for decades and decades under a failed communist regime.
Earlier this month, Cubans took to the street in a historic demonstration of the will of the people of Cuba. The regime responded with violence and repression, mass detentions, sham trials, and people disappearing who -- who have spoken out. Just disappearing. Family members, I'm told, are not able -- have no idea where their family members are back in Cuba. And -- in a brazen violation of the rights of the Cuban people.
The Cuban Americans are hurting. They're hurting because their loved ones are suffering. And it's, quite frankly, intolerable.
So, I want the Cuban Americans to know that we -- all around this table and myself included -- see your pain, we hear your voices, and we hear the cries of freedom coming from the island.
The United States is taking concerted action to bolster the cause of the Cuban people. We've brought to bear the strength of our diplomacy, rallying nations to speak out and increase pressure on the regime. And we're holding the regime accountable.
Last week, we sanctioned the head of Cuban armed forces and the government -- a government entity called the ""Black Berets"" for their involvement in suppressing protesters.
And, today, we are adding sanctions against the Revolutionary National Police, as well as individual sanctions against the chief and deputy chief -- the chief and deputy chief.
And we're going to continue to add sanctions on individuals that carry out -- that carry out the regime's abuses.
At the same time, we're increasing direct support for the Cuban people by pursuing every option available to provide Internet access to help the Cuban bypass -- the Cuban people bypass the censorship that's being mandatorily imposed.
You always know something is not going well when the -- a country will not allow -- will not allow their people to be engaged in -- be on the Internet and being able to make their case known around the world.
And we're expanding our assistance to political prisoners and dissidents.
And the direct State -- and I've directed the State Department and the Treasury Department to provide me, within one month, recommendations of how to maximize the flow of remittances to the Cuban people, without the Cuban military taking their cut.
And we're working to increase U.S. staffing at our embassy while prioritizing the safety of our personnel.
So, we've got a lot to discuss with this group. So, we got -- and mostly, I'm here to listen. I want to know what their ideas are. And you are some of the best experts on the issue.
The first person to bring this to my attention and to make sure that we were on top of this was Senator Menendez. And we think that -- you know, the American -- the Cuban American people are actually the best ambassadors for the Cuban people.
And so, my administration is going to make sure that their voices are included and uplifted at every step of the way. And we're gong to get down to business.
So, thank you all for bothering to come in. I appreciate it.
Q: Will there be more sanctions coming up, Mr. President? Or is that it, today?
THE PRESIDENT: I beg your pardon?
Q: I said: Will there be more sanctions against Cuba coming up or are you stopping with what you did today?
THE PRESIDENT: We are -- there will be more, unless there's some drastic change in Cuba, which I don't anticipate.
Thank you.
